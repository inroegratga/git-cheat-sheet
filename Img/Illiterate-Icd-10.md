In a more general sense, illiterate may signify a lack of familiarity with some body of knowledge (as in being "musically illiterate") or indicate a lack of competence in or familiarity with literature.

I really, genuinely, cannot see the problem with being judgemental. There are correct ways to speak (and to write), less correct but acceptable ways, and incorrect (and therefore unacceptable) ways. No-one would (I think) claim that there is only *one* way to speak (or write) correctly, but there is a clear continuum between correct and incorrect, and I for one see no problem with someone being judgemental about usages that are clearly incorrect ("we was", "we're gonna", "I ain't done nothing", etc.). All three of these examples are, to my mind, clearly illiterate usages, and I would have no hesitation in describing them as such.
 
He seems to be conflating typographical errors, solecisms, informal usages, dialect, and innovations or neologisms. Exactly how much you might personally want to copy edit any of these would depend on the demands of the context and relevant style. There's nothing wrong with advising people about how to write and speak in a way which won't annoy your interlocutors in a given circumstance, but it's not a measure of your worth as a human being. That's where it's at.
 
As to the pronunciation and orthographical difference between "comptroller" and "controller", and their etymology, I can only suggest that it's worth a careful look at the first page or so of internet entries on these words (I used Google).

Garner has this reputation as the sophisticate's usage writer. This reputation comes partly from his pseudo-quantitative hand-waving, and partly from his largely avoiding obvious name calling. That last one can carry you a long ways. Look good in a suit and have a calm affect, and you can say the same things as those spittle-flecked maniacs and still get invited to respectable parties. But the mask slips from time to time.
 
Hmm, my computer's spell-check feature is advising me to consider
more carefully my "orthographical" (vs. "orthographic".
There seems to be a moral there.
My favorite spell-check story: Some years ago a student, Iranian as it happens, submitted to me a good a paper on Persian and Middle Persian poetry. When I faulted him for writing "hemstitches"
("hem-stitches"?) for "hemistichs", he blamed it, maybe rightly,
on his spell-check.

On the contrary, pronouncing 'comptroller' with the the 'p' shows that you have learned it by reading it, as does pronouncing any word exactly as spelled. People can't win. If I had \*heard\* 'comptroller', I would have written it as 'controller'. The only way people can spell and pronounce it 'correctly' is by hearing \*and\* reading it.
FWIW, Dictionary.com records the 'spelling pronunciation' alongside the standard one, which shows that enough people must be saying it.
 
I think people buy finger-wagging usage guides not to be spanked, but to build and support their feelings of superiority. The buyers of usage guides want to know rules that they can see that other people are flouting. For that, it doesn't matter if the rules have evidential support.
 
I suspect the problem may be that we don't have different adjectives for "of or pertaining to the functionally-literate" and "of or pertaining to the literati." Nor do we have different pejorative-sounding antonyms for these different senses of "literate." Of course, viewing "literate" in the "of or pertaining to the literati" sense as a compliment and "illiterate" in the opposite sense as a pejorative is based on a rather significant unexamined minor premise, namely the assumption that the literati is a social class or subculture that is praiseworthy rather than blameworthy (or maybe even just neutral in moral terms).
 
I remember that when studying French at university, our lecturer pointed out the difficulty of the English words "literate" and "illiterate". French has a clear distinction between "analphabte" meaning "not knowing how to read or write" and "illettr" for "unlettered".
 
I agree with Cervantes, that Garner "seems to be conflating typographical errors, solecisms, informal usages, dialect, and innovations or neologisms". But especially in the phrase concerning misspelled word in "otherwise literate publications", I think there is a criticism of sloppiness, of not properly checking a text before publishing it.
 
Daily newspapers are expected to contain a number of misprints, it is simply not reasonable to expect every word of every article to be perfect when the paper has to be put to bed and then printed so that copies are at newsagents' shops by 05h00 the next day.
 
Perhaps Garner is also criticizing a general "slackening" of style in what would have been, a few years ago, quite straight-laced and formal publications, and which are still aimed at a very wide readership.
 
I find it annoying to read in an English language book on science, technology or business, aimed at a global readership, that the solving of some problem or the taking of some decision was "a no-brainer". I've made numerous edits in colleagues works to remove what I consider overly idiomatic phrases such as "take the bull by the horns", "grasp the nettle" and "bite the bullet"
 
There's a time and a place for most things in writing, and in fiction just about anything is acceptable, so long as it is consistent with the characters in the story. In directly reported speech, I can accept having the CEO or CTO of some corporation say "it was a no-brainer", or "we went the whole nine yards".
 
I for one see no problem with someone being judgemental about usages that are clearly incorrect ("we was", "we're gonna", "I ain't done nothing", etc.). All three of these examples are, to my mind, clearly illiterate usages, and I would have no hesitation in describing them as such.
 
"Lettered" is a bit antique as a way of saying "has read a lot of stuff, especially the stuff you're supposed to have read to be a respectable intellectual type". And it has the added problem of being the American university equivalent of getting your Blue in something.
 
So for almost 70 years I have been taught, and have believed, and continue to believe, that there is correct speech, and there is incorrect speech, and just because some forms of incorrect speech have been adopted as the lingua franca of certain social groups, this no more makes them correct than would (for example) the publication of a book entitled "'ow ter speak proper" which sought to place a cachet on such uneducated (and illiterate) usage.
 
How do people know what they are? There is no Academie Anglaise that has the authority to promulgate such standards. And if you point to what Garner or some other expert says, what do you do when I point to what a different expert says?
 
And what about the fact that the kinds of usages and rules that Garner covers represent only a tiny fraction of the usages and rules that are part of the English language? How know you that sentence this ungrammatical is?
 
We know for a fact that usages that were once denounced as being incorrect are now regarded as uncontroversially acceptable. How did that happen? At what point did those usages change from wrong to right?
 
To whom do the standards of correctness that you follow apply? They obviously don't apply to people who speak Italian or Japanese, since those are different languages. But what about Americans and Australians, who speak English, but in ways that differ in many respects from what you would regard as correct. And if you say, well those are different dialects, and they have their own standards of correctness, why isn't the same thing isn't true of the South-East London "patois" that you apparently grew up speaking? While there's certainly a difference between those examples, is it a difference in kind or only a difference in degree?
 
It is true that people are often judged by the social class associations of their dialect. That doesn't make their dialect "wrong," it just means that they have pragmatic reasons to become adept at code shifting. We all use different styles in different contexts, usually unconsciously. What's right in a New York Review of Books essay is often not right in the pool hall or construction site. But you'd be in just as much trouble making the mistake in either direction.
 
As a fundamental literacy instructor of adults who have struggled to read and write their whole lives for reasons that have nothing whatsoever to do with intelligence level, laziness, or moral inferiority, this kind of pompous and dismissive rhetoric enrages me. Mr. Garner may know a lot about the intricacies of the English language, but he is an utter ignoramus when it comes to the lived experiences of actual illiterate or semi-literate people.
 
Instead, I'll just say that I think it's beneficial for those who speak nonstandard dialects to learn standard English, and that demeaning them by condemning the dialect that they speak is not a good way to accomplish that goal. If anything, doing so is likely to alienate them from the broader linguistic community, and therefore to worsen whatever "ghetto mentality" might already exist.
 
In comments on a blog post, when responding to a prior comment and quoting part of what it said, it is a convention to put "@" before the commenter's name, as an indication that they are the source of the quoted language. It is not considered to be part of the spelling of the name (just as the colon following your last name is not considered part of the name.
