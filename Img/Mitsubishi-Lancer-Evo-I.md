"Thanks to our advanced high-tech engineering and safety features, the Mitsubishi Lancer, Outlander and Outlander Sport have consistently achieved high IIHS safety ratings," said Don Swearingen, Executive Vice President of MMNA. "The Mitsubishi RISE safety body construction system is the perfect example of this kind of technology. In the event of an accident, energy is absorbed and deflected away from the occupant cell, which enhances passenger protection."
 
Additional standard safety features found on the Mitsubishi Lancer, Outlander and Outlander Sport include seven air bags, Active Stability Control, Traction Control Logic, Tire Pressure Monitoring System, and Anti-lock braking system with Electronic brake-force Distribution and Brake Assist.

Mitsubishi lancer evo 4
Hello friends
I am very happy to have brought the Lancer Evo IV project to the rendering stage. My focus was on rendering, materials, and lighting, and the result I achieved was a realistic render that was very satisfying. Of course, I had other ideas, but the limitations of the rendering engine prevented me from implementing them. In the next project, I will definitely use the LuxCoreRender engine. However, for this project, the Cycles rendering engine was sufficient. I hope you enjoy the result of my work!
