It is well-known that tango was a dance born in the poor neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires, Argentine; it first spread to Europe after World War I and then to Istanbul via Pera (Beyoğlu), and from throughout Turkey. Like the jazz of America's black people, the rebetiko of the Anatolian Greeks and the fado of the Lisbon poor, the tango is the music of lower class. Most probably it benefited from Spanish music, the habanera of Cuba and other similar traditions. Behind every form of art there is a combination of many different traditions. But as a result, the tango was sui generis, unique.
 
It is thought that tango took shape in the last two or three decades of the 19th century. As mentioned above, the tango is music that blossomed in the dens of the suburban districts of Buenos Aires, and from the very beginning was accompanied by dance. Both as music and dance, with its macho style and energy, the tango reflects the main characteristics of the world into which it was born. Indeed, the word macho is itself a concept that spread to the world from Spanish?
 
Many musical genres have been born into the "underground" like this; after some time, such music is learned by the dominant upper class, attracting their attention as well. This, for most of the time, is a sign that such a movement might spread to the world over a period of time. Indeed, the genres I listed above, particularly jazz, have always followed such a course. Maybe, since the tango is a dance as well, it quickly became popular all over the world. Not resting on what they took from Argentina, many countries started to compose their own tangos.
 
Argentina's greatest tango singer was Carlos Gardel. He was born out of wedlock in Toulous in 1890. Because his mother later moved to Argentina, Carlos Gardel grew up in Buenos Aires. He was recognized and loved not only in Latin America, but also all over the world. He visited United States and many European countries (in particular, Paris) frequently. The tango became popular in Europe in the years following World War I and Gardel popularized it even more. He died in 1935 in a plane crash in Columbia. His tragic death at a young age also increased his popularity.
 
Reaching Europe, the tango found itself in a quite different atmosphere. It encountered not jerky movements of the apache, but romantic gentlemen and ladies. Thus, it was softened and refined. In some countries, for example in Finland, it was embraced almost as a native music genre. German, French, Russian and Spanish tangos came into being. Turkey and Greece did not fall behind. Even the Arab singers in the Maghreb and Lebanon sang Arabic tangos (like the Algerian Jew, Lili Boniche).
 
The first tango composer in Turkey was by Necip Celal Antel (1908-1957) This first composition was Mazi, one of the most beautiful Turkish tangos. The first recorded tango was composed by another famous Turkish tango composer, Fehmi Ege (1902-1978), and Seyyan Hanım sang: On a Moonlit Night. In fact, preceding these two, there was a Tango turque, composed by Muhlis Sabahattin, but this was composed only as an instrumental (Muhlis Sabahattin also composed Valse Istanbul).
 
The Westernization movement that started in the last years of the Ottoman era influenced the musical field as a matter of course. While the tango was being slowly shaped in Buenos Aires in Argentina, the people of Istanbul invented the kanto. The kanto was a genre that was sung before "dramas" in Direklerarası Theater, and was considered to address the common folk and was sung by non-Muslims, as the cantos were considered to be immoral. However, cantos were very popular.
 
Tango also became popular. However, it is possible to state that the level of society which the tango directly addressed was less "vulgar" as compared to that of the canto. The tango was more of a "Western product", and a music from the West; moreover, it was a dance. The dance was something that the common folk were not familiar with and were timid about learning it. Therefore, from the beginning, tango was redolent of an "elite" atmosphere.
 
As mentioned before, not only in Turkey, but also everywhere in Europe the tango ceased to be the tango that had been created in Argentina. This can be considered as moving up the social ladder. The dance was performed in an amorous attitude; after gazing at tangoing couples, Clemenceau asked the people: "Why are they standing?" But while this cuddling was not as tough or macho as it was in Argentina, it did not have a clear sexual implication, but rather a more romantic sexuality or amorousness. As can be expected, this was also the case in Turkey. In fact, the romantic-sexual style was tamed down eve
