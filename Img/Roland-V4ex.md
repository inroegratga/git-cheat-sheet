So I am assuming this 15 pin vga to component cable I ordered from Monoprice is correct.
@Genlok also confirmed this is likely the correct cable, has had success connecting to v4ex with a similar cable, and thought maybe I had a bad cable the first time. He also suggested setting input 4 settings to 480i instead of auto.

It hangs for a tenth to quarter second. I think it may be that the buffer to the internal scaler fills up and resets. That is what it looks like. At any rate in those circumstances, I am just feeding the cortex into the v4ex->monitor or capture device and not taxing the v4ex in any other way.
I also find it can flatten some colours slightly.
Neither of these things keeps me from using it live though.
 
The Roland V-4EX Four Channel Digital Video Mixer with Effects is a live production switcher and web streaming device that improves on the Roland V-4 Video Mixer by adding a built-in multiviewer with touch control screen and HDMI in/out, with 1080p/RGB WUXGA (1920 x 1200) support on one input, and 1080p output. You can switch between four video sources and deliver via HDMI, RGB Component, composite video and stream via the built-in USB port. Four built-in frame synchronizers, one per input, allow you to support and cleanly switch input video from sources that are not gen-locked. This unit is well-suited for clubs, concerts, worship, events, weddings, education and sporting events.
 
The V-4EX features a built in Keyer for Luma, Chroma and PIP keying effects, including the 259 transition and 148 built-in effects. The switcher features a familiar analog T-bar transition controller with a choice of three transition curves and the T-bar itself can be rotated for user comfort without affecting its operation. The built-in audio mixer accepts audio embedded in the HDMI stream, or from an unbalanced analog source via the two RCA jacks, and embeds the mixed audio in the HDMI output stream. You can also delay the audio by up to 4 frames to adjust the "lip sync" of your video.
 
The built in multiview screen can show your four inputs on the screen at the same time and you can transition from one camera to the next by merely touching the camera view on the monitor screen. The V-4EX features an an output scaler that can scale your video to 1080p or 1920 x 1200 via the HDMI/RGB output. The program feed is available for streaming or capturing to a computer via the USB Type B port on the unit.
