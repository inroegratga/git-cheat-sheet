hello, microsoft can't help me with an office 365 license activation problem on a shared windows server 2019 computer.
my license is Micorosoft 365 apps for enterprise.
after several video conferences with microsoft it doesn't seem to find a solution, by installing my office on another client's environment it works.
The only difference between the two environments is the management of windows server devices that are seen as devices in my no, intune is not active and the machines have not joined in Azure AD.
