While traveling from California to Colorado to pick up his childhood friend and crush Venna, Lewis Thomas is forced to stop in Salt Lake City after he learns his estranged brother Fuller has been arrested. Lewis bails him out and Fuller tags along for the ride.
 
Fuller has a CB radio installed in Lewis's car and the two begin listening in on truckers' chatter. Fuller coaxes Lewis into playing a prank on a truck driver nicknamed Rusty Nail, asking him to pretend to be a woman named Candy Cane. They set up a meeting with Rusty Nail in a motel where Lewis and Fuller are spending the night; they tell Rusty Nail that Candy Cane will be in room 17, the room of a rude businessman with whom Fuller had an encounter at the front desk. When Rusty Nail arrives, the brothers listen from the adjoining room; an argument and sounds of a scuffle are briefly heard.
 
The next morning, Lewis and Fuller learn that the police found the businessman on the highway, with his lower jaw ripped off. Lewis admits they were involved and Sheriff Ritter accosts them for their role in the incident, but lets them go. Back on the road, Rusty Nail is heard again on the radio looking for Candy Cane. Lewis reveals the prank to Rusty Nail and he demands an apology, but Fuller insults him instead. Rusty Nail then notes they should get their taillight fixed, indicating he is following them.
 
They drive to a nearby gas station and unsuccessfully attempt to contact Sheriff Ritter. Seeing a large truck pull into the gas station, they flee from the scene into a dead end, with the truck driver chasing them. The driver turns out to be a kind stranger trying to return Lewis's credit card, which he left behind in panic. The real Rusty Nail then shows up in his truck and, as he slowly crushes Lewis's car against a tree, Fuller hysterically apologizes. Rusty Nail drives away, declaring his actions to be simply a retaliatory joke.
 
Believing themselves safe, the brothers arrive in Colorado and pick up Venna. They stop at a motel and, as Lewis falls asleep, Rusty Nail calls his room, revealing he has noticed Venna has joined them. They flee from the motel, but see messages from Rusty Nail spray painted on road signs, instructing them to look in the trunk; they find the CB radio Fuller had previously thrown from the window of the car. Rusty Nail then contacts them again via the radio, announcing that he has kidnapped Venna's friend Charlotte, and he directs them to a cornfield where the three get split up. Rusty Nail kidnaps Venna.
 
Rusty Nail sets up a meeting at another motel in room 17, mirroring the false date with which he was pranked. He sets up a trap that will kill Venna if the room door is opened. Fuller attempts to get in the room by a back window, but is injured by Rusty Nail and gets stuck outside. Lewis attempts to free Fuller as the police arrive to help Venna. Meanwhile, Rusty Nail's truck appears uphill and begins rolling down towards the motel. The brothers free Venna in time and everyone escapes as the truck crashes into the motel. As the police investigate Rusty Nail's truck, they see a dead body in the driver's seat and Charlotte, still alive, in the back.

While Lewis, Fuller and Venna are treated for their injuries on scene, they learn that the dead man inside the truck was the friendly truck driver who returned Lewis's credit card. From the CB in the ambulance, the group hears Rusty Nail's voice, learning that he is alive and free.[2]
 
On the DVD release, there is a 29-minute-long alternate ending, and four other shorter alternate endings. The main one featured Rusty Nail's shotgun suicide and numerous bodies are found by the police in his trailer. One featured Rusty Nail being arrested, another being beaten in a fight with both Thomas brothers, another wherein he is blown up in his truck, and another saw Rusty Nail run over with his own truck. The ending featured in the actual theatrical cut of the film is the only ending in which Rusty Nail lives. There are also numerous deleted scenes.
 
In the alternate ending where Rusty Nail's truck explodes, there is a water tower behind the truck as it burns. The original intention was to have the truck hit the water tower and have the water come down and put the flames out so that it would be believable if Rusty Nail survived. However, time constraints kept the scene from being filmed. The water tower cost over $100,000.
 
Sobieski filmed two romantic interludes, one with Zahn and one with Walker during the shooting and re-shooting of the film. Both scenes ended up getting cut. This may explain why Venna appears to be romantically interested in both of them.
 
In July 1999, it was announced that Leelee Sobieski was set to star in *Squelch*, the film's working title, with John Dahl directing from a screenplay by Clay Tarver and J. J. Abrams. The other parts had not yet been cast, although Tobey Maguire and Steve Zahn were understood to have been offered roles.[4] In the next month, Paul Walker joined the cast alongside Sobieski and Zahn. The film's budget was initially reported to be $20 million.[5]
 
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 74% of 116 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The website's consensus reads: "A well-constructed B-movie thriller, *Joy Ride* keeps up the necessary level of tension and chills. Critics also liked Zahn's performance as the goofball older brother."[9] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 75 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[10]
 
Kevin Thomas of the *Los Angeles Times* called the film "terrific escapist fare, stylish, outrageous and compelling." Thomas stated, "*Joy Ride* is a high-wire act, full of risks and shameless in resorting to old ploys only to put a fresh spin on them. As an action comedy played at the darkest pitch, *Joy Ride* is a plus for all concerned, especially its actors."[11]
 
A. O. Scott of *The New York Times* wrote that the film "is much more effectively terrifying than the usual overplotted, underwritten Hollywood thriller." Scott also commented, "It's also surprisingly funny, thanks to a playful script by Clay Tarver and J. J. Abrams and a mischievous performance by Mr. Zahn."[12]
 
Joe Leydon of *Variety* called the film a "hot-wired, white-knuckle thriller" and wrote that it "maneuvers more smoothly, and avoids plot holes more consistently, as it steadily gains momentum while speeding through familiar territory."[16]
 
Paul L of *Bloody Disgusting* opined, "The film yields every now and then so viewers can catch their breath, but once this taut and frantic thriller picks up speed again, *Joy Ride* earns its place as one of the best movies of its kind."[17]
 
The trailer also continues to highlight a dynamic reminiscent of the 1997 original, featuring a team of scientists intent on making an impact. This time, instead of **Cary Elwes**' financially motivated Jonas Miller, Powell steps in as a thrill-seeking adventurer pursuing "the finger of god" just for the thrill. The film appears to be a propulsive summer blockbuster, the type that audiences look forward to for sheer entertainment.
 
The original film centers on a pair of scientists who are also a separated couple. The finalization of their divorce is delayed, coinciding with the emergence of a rare storm front. This timing gives them the chance to chase a historic EF-5 supercell tornado in Oklahoma. **Bill Paxton** ****and**** **Helen Hunt** portrayed the lead characters, Bill and Jo Harding, in the film directed by **Jan de Bont**.
 
Recently, Collider's **Steve Weintraub** spoke with the film's writer, **Mark L. Smith**, while he was busy promoting his latest film at the time, **Boys in the Boat,**with the writer confirming it would exist in the same universe, but would be "a separate story." He said:
 
"It's not a continuation of the original. But it's just a real wild ride with some good, fun characters. Hopefully, we can tap into what the original had because that thing is just iconic. But it's so cool to have a director like Isaac taking on something like this. It's just so out of his norm, and I think he's having fun. I was texting with him a couple days ago, and it's just all craziness of it."
 
Driving Innovation Hendrickson pioneered the use of a single, large-diameter bushing in trailer air suspensions with our TRI-FUNCTIONAL bushing. Used in unison with rigid beams and solid axle connections, TRI-FUNCTIONAL bushings delivert enhanced road stability and ride quality in approved on- and off-highway applications. The result is a dependable suspension system that offers extended life, reduced maintenance and maximum protection for cargo, drivers and equipment.
 
Three Main Functions The void design and material composition of these unique bushings are critical to controlling the horizontal, vertical and roll forces a trailer generates rolling down the road. A key element of the pivot connection, the TRI-FUNCTIONAL bushing is contained inside the beam with sufficient compression to permit it to flex but not rotate. Compression of one bushing combined with expansion of the opposing bushing helps keep wheels on the road during turns and over irregular surfaces.
