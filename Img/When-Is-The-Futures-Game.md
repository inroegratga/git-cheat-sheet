Futures margin, also known as a "performance bond," is the amount of money you are required to deposit in your futures account to establish and maintain a futures position. Futures margin is not a loan. If at any given time the funds in your account drop below the minimum regulatory requirement, or "house" margin requirements, you may be required to immediately deposit additional funds to maintain your position, or your position may be liquidated at a loss. You will be liable for any resulting debits.

E-mini S&P 500 futures are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and allow traders to gain exposure to the S&P 500 index, a widely recognized barometer of the U.S. stock market. E-mini S&P 500 futures have made futures trading more accessible to traders and they are the most commonly traded U.S. stock index future offered at the CME. In recent years, CME Group has introduced the Micro E-mini S&P 500 futures contract which is 1/10th of the size of the standard E-mini S&P 500 futures contract.
 
E-mini S&P 500 futures can provide investors and traders with an efficient way to gain speculative exposure to the U.S. stock market, or they may be used to hedge stock portfolios against overall market risk. E-mini S&P 500 futures may also be spread against other popular stock index futures, like Dow futures, or against futures on individual stocks. Options on E-mini futures and Micro E-mini S&P 500 futures are also available.
 
It is important to understand the benefits and risks involved with E-mini S&P 500 futures before placing a futures trade. With E-mini S&P 500 futures you can trade nearly 24 hours a day, five days a week and take advantage of potential trading opportunities regardless of market direction. E-mini S&P 500 futures also provide the ability to trade with greater leverage and can allow a more efficient use of trading capital. However, trading leveraged products like E-mini S&P 500 futures is not suitable for all investors. It involves risks that greater losses can occur with smaller market movements, and more than your initial investment can be lost.

Another important factor is that most futures traders and investors won't want to take possession of the underlying commodities. They will close their positions long before expiry to reduce the risk of needing to store, say, 1,000 barrels of crude oil.
 
Contango can be caused by several factors, including inflation expectations, expected future supply disruptions, and the carrying costs of the commodity in question. Some investors will seek to profit from contango by exploiting arbitrage opportunities between the futures and spot prices.
 
Offsetting or liquidating a position is the simplest and most common method of exiting a trade. When offsetting a position, a trader is able to realize all profits or losses associated with that position without taking physical or cash delivery of the asset.
 
To offset a position, a trader must take out an opposite and equal transaction to neutralize the trade. For example, a trader who is short two WTI Crude Oil contracts expiring in September will need to buy two WTI Crude Oil contracts expiring on the same date. The difference in price between his initial position and offset position will represent the profit or loss on the trade.
 
Rollover is when a trader moves his position from the front month contract to a another contract further in the future. Traders will determine when they need to move to the new contract by watching volume of both the expiring contract and next month contract. A trader who is going to roll their positions may choose to switch to the next month contract when volume has reached a certain level in that contract.
 
When rolling forward, a trader will simultaneously offset his current position and establish a new position in the next contract month. For example, a trader who is long four S&P 500 futures contracts expiring in September will simultaneously sell four Sept ES contracts and buy four Dec or further away ES contracts.
 
If a trader has not offset or rolled his position prior to contract expiration, the contract will expire and the trader will go to settlement. At this point, a trader with a short position will be obligated to deliver the underlying asset under the terms of the original contract. This can be either physical delivery or cash settlement depending on the market.
 
You have choices when it comes to your futures positions at expiration. Knowing how you want to manage your trades around rollover and expiration is important as it will directly impact the outcome of the trades.
