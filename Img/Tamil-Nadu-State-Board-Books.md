When we meet, Kathir speaks about how he stumbled onto cover design, worlds away from the village of Arachalur in Erode district where he was raised. His words in Tamil spill out heavy with allusion and symbolism while describing his work, very different from the economy of his style when he executes designs at his lab on the DPI Campus, Chennai.
 
Arachalur has a Sri Lankan Tamil Refugee Camp and Kathir spent his teens painting their houses and working as a signboard artist, marking out public telephone booths, temple statues and provision stores.
 
While Kathir was working as a garment industry supervisor, Gunasekhar, an illustrator, and now a lecturer at The American College, Madurai, encouraged him to move to Chennai, and Kathir plunged headlong into work as a layout artist for Tamil magazines such as Kunkumam Thozhi , Minmini and Penne Nee . He has also designed the covers for novels by Sujatha and worked as a designer with a Tamil newspaper before moving to school textbooks.

**Samacheer Kalvi** or **Tamil Nadu Uniform System of School Education** or **Equitable education system** is a School Education Department of Government of Tamil Nadu, India programme to integrate the various school educational systems within the state. Uniform System of School Education was implemented by **Tamil Nadu Uniform System of School Education Act 2010** which paves way for quality education to all children without any discrimination based on their economic, social or cultural background. The new system of education was introduced for classes I and VI in the 2010 academic year.
 
The system was introduced by Karunanidhi-led DMK government. It was scrapped by Jayalalithaa-led AIADMK government shortly after assuming office in May 2011.[1] The scrapping was challenged in the court. The Supreme Court of India in its verdict in August 2011, directed the AIADMK government to implement it.[2]
 
There are over 12 million students in four streams of school education comprising about 45,000 state board schools, 11,000 matriculation schools, 25 oriental schools and 50 Anglo-Indian schools, with different syllabus, textbooks and schemes of examinations.
 
The main need for this system to be proclaimed as the syllabus in Tamil Nadu, was that all the school students must have uniform study, diminishing the variations between the Matriculation or CBSE Students and the Government school Students. The motivation for a uniform syllabus was obtained from the Ex. Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, K. Kamaraj who was the first to initiate a uniform dress code in schools to reduce the differentiation between students from households with varying income. Tamil Nadu government also published school books in digital format.[3]
 
On 9 August 2011, the Supreme Court of India rejected Tamil Nadu State Government's request to drop the Tamil Nadu Uniform System of School Education and also directed the state government to implement the Uniform System of School Education (Amendment) Act within 10 days i.e., within 19 August 2011.[5] The Supreme Court of India in its order said that any sort of objectionable material such as p
