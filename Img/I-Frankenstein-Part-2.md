I played the tail. It was my job to stick this seven-foot-long papier-mch monstrosity out from the side of the stage and wiggle it back and forth. One night I wiggled it a bit too much and it broke. During the performance, I had to repair it with a broom stick and about two miles of duct tape.

Imagine for a moment a world where every time you go to the doctor's office, the doctor lays you out on a table, flips a couple of latches on your side, opens you up like a violin case, and goes to work fixing whatever issue you came in with. The doctor can turn you off, restart you, connect diagnostic machinery to specific organs -- whatever helps. At the end, he closes you up, secures the latches, and sends you on your way.
 
The problem, of course, is that our bodies don't work that way. You can't just shut us off, put us in diagnostic mode, or really even open us up in any kind of meaningful way without difficulty or consequence. Modern medicine has had to learn how to work around these limitations and engineer solutions. We've developed diagnostic tooling -- everything from the humble, iconic stethoscope to feats of engineering like MRI machines -- and we've had to discover non-invasive therapies and medicines for treating issues once discovered and properly diagnosed.
 
But I'm not a doctor. I'm an engineer. If you're reading this, you probably are too. This is the best metaphor my tired mind could conjure while driving into the office today to answer a question that's been bothering me lately.

The long, jargon-riddled version of the question is this: "Why is it so difficult to effectively communicate the value proposition of compliant, production-ready diagnostic and support tooling to product teams?"
 
The second question is perhaps a generalization, bordering on stereotyping. The former is hard on the eyes but more accurate. Regardless, the conclusion that I arrived at, which was sort of an epiphany for me, but which may (or may not) sound obvious to you, is this:
 
If your company is like the company I work for, you have compliance restrictions on access to production environments. Returning to the metaphor, your production environment is a human. Humans and production environments cannot stop. There is no maintenance mode. You cannot simply unlatch it, open it up like a violin case, and do whatever you want when it's not working right. Like a human, you cannot open it up in any kind of meaningful way without difficulty or consequence.
 
When we build them, we have the ability to do anything we want with them. No system is a black box. Debuggers can be hooked up at will. Free access to the data layer is a given. We flay the beast and watch every organ as it functions -- and it's all allowed. So we come to a place where we've trained ourselves to solve problems in a lab, but when Frankenstein's monster comes alive and walks out the door we cannot put it back on the table.
 
We try to reproduce errors observed in production in our dev environments, flailing blindly, hoping to stumble across the root cause often armed with only two data points (the version of our deployed application and the reported error state) and our intuition to connect them. But it's not the same. It's not the same, and the whole time, while you're torturing the clone in your lab, your monster is out burning villages.
 
To come back to the epiphany that probably confused you, what I'm trying to articulate is that the problem of fixing immediate software issues and the problem of providing the capability to do so in production are two very different problems, and as product developers, we tend to only think about (or focus on) one of them: the former.
 
Put in the terms of the metaphor, when we are tasked with building our human, we are also effectively being tasked with building an MRI, a stethoscope and everything in between. We are tasked to discover medicines and non-invasive treatments. In our minds these tasks are entirely different, but both are required for success.
 
So how do we express the value proposition of magnetic resonance imaging and penicillin to engineers? It really comes down to the value that we place on unburned villagers. When Frankie gets that look in his eye and reaches for the torch, he must be stopped. Fast.
 
You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement ofan enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings. I arrivedhere yesterday, and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare andincreasing confidence in the success of my undertaking.
 
These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets whoseeffusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. I also became a poet andfor one year lived in a paradise of my own creation; I imagined that I alsomight obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare areconsecrated. You are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore thedisappointment. But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, andmy thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.
 
Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking. I can, evennow, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise.I commenced by inuring my body to hardship. I accompanied the whale-fishers onseveral expeditions to the North Sea; I voluntarily endured cold, famine,thirst, and want of sleep; I often worked harder than the common sailors duringthe day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics, the theory ofmedicine, and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurermight derive the greatest practical advantage. Twice I actually hired myself asan under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I mustown I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in thevessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness, so valuabledid he consider my services.
 
And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose? Mylife might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to everyenticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging voice wouldanswer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopesfluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a longand difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: Iam required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustainmy own, when theirs are failing.
 
I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and myintention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying theinsurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessaryamong those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to sailuntil the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how can Ianswer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years, will passbefore you and I may meet. If I fail, you will see me again soon, or never.
 
How slowly the time passes here, encompassed as I am by frost and snow! Yet asecond step is taken towards my enterprise. I have hired a vessel and amoccupied in collecting my sailors; those whom I have already engaged appear tobe men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage.
 
Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on thewide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet somefeelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these ruggedbosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage andenterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase morecharacteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an Englishman, andin the midst of national and professional prejudices, unsoftened bycultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity. I first becameacquainted with him on board a whale vessel; finding that he was unemployed inthis city, I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise.
 
Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can conceive aconsolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am wavering in myresolutions. Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage is only now delayeduntil the weather shall permit my embarkation. The winter has been dreadfullysevere, but the spring promises well, and it is considered as a remarkablyearly season, so that perhaps I may sail sooner than I expected. I shall donothing rashly: you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence andconsiderateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care.
 
But to return to dearer considerations. Shall I meet you again, after havingtraversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of Africa orAmerica? I dare not expect such success, yet I cannot bear to look on thereverse of the picture. Continue for the present to write to me by everyopportunity: I may receive your letters on some occasions when I need them mostto support my spirits. I love you very tenderly. Remember me with affection,should you never hear from me again.
