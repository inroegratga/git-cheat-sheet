When buying or selling clothing internationally choosing the correct size can be a minefield. Even if the actual size of a garment is the same, the way sizes are displayed can vary by just a few numbers or even a whole different set of numbers which only adds to the confusion. Here at Dutch Label Shop, we have created size conversion charts that you can keep handy to refer back to when needed. Our size conversion charts will help you quickly find the correct size when online shopping, or perfect for when you need to label garments for customers around the world.
 
Make it easy for your customers to buy! Displaying size conversions on your website is a helpful option for customers to refer to in case they are more familiar with a different sizing standard. This gives customers more of the information they need to purchase right at their fingertips without having to navigate away from your website.
 
Please note, size conversion charts are a guideline and exact sizing can differ from brand to brand, so for the most accurate way make sure to include precise measurements when listing products online.
 
Depending on where you are based, baby and childrens clothes can be sized quite differently to what you might be used to. In The UK and US sizes are dictated by age (first month, then years) compared with Europe which often prefers to use the child's height (in centimeters) for sizing.
 
The way men's sizes are displayed can vary depending on the item. For most items made with stretchy or knit fabric such as T-shirts, polos, and jumpers sizes are often shown using the Small, Medium, Large, format. For items where fit is important, sizes are shown in a numerical format that has a more precise range.

As there are no international standards for sizing, converting sizes is used as an estimate only. If you have any confusion regarding sizing, you can contact the manufacturer for specific measurements or clarification. At DLS, we sell a large range of size labels for whatever your size requirements are, so make sure to check those out.
 
Our extensive range of baby clothing is divided into several categories, each offering baby clothes in a variety of styles, colours, fabrics, and fits. Here are some of our most popular items and why we love them:
 
Of course, baby pants or baby sweater from SNURK are great fun. But it is even more fun to go for the complete set of baby clothes. In a set you will find your favorite cheerful print shirt with matching trousers. That makes you happy, doesn't it? The nice and soft fabric of the baby pajamas allows them to fall asleep without any worries. In addition, they can also wear these baby suits while rolling, crawling and playing.
 
When you look at our website, you will be bombarded with all kinds of fun and funny designs. For example, have you seen these baby pajamas with pink elephants? Or how about this baby clothing set with James our dachshund? All our baby clothes are made from soft organic cotton, because what we think is most important is that baby suits should fit comfortably. The nice fit allows babies to roll and crawl comfortably without clothing that is too tight. In addition to rolling around during the day, the baby suit can also be used as pajamas at night. That is why we also call our clothing Horizontal Wear.
 
It is not surprising at all if you occasionally get jealous when you see the baby clothing sets. That feeling can happen to anyone. That is why we have also made these two piece sets in larger sizes. This way you can walk around in the same outfit with the whole family! Isn't that nice? Take a quick look at the kids combi sets, ladies combi sets or men's combi sets.
 
Just like our designs, we pay attention to people and the environment. That is why our products are always made from soft organic cotton. The baby clothes are put together with love here in Europe. Because the clothing is made as close as possible, we can limit our CO2 emissions. A few times a year we travel to Portugal to work with the people in the factories to create creations that we are proud of together. Our baby clothes have the Oeko-Tex quality mark. This means that it is free of toxic substances and a sustainable wastewater system is used.
 
Welcome, since you are visiting Cribster, there is a fair chance that you are expecting or already a very proud and happy parent. You might have noticed that getting the best products for (the arrival of) your little bundle of joy is a hassle, and all of that for products you use for only a couple of months at the most. An expensive exercise and even more important, a wasteful one!
 
We also **rent out cribs** alongside of baby clothes. You can rent the best cradles for the period you need it, together with the bedding if you want, and return it afterwards. A perfect solution for such a expensive item that will only take up space as soon as your little one has outgrown it. Very convenient for every new parent, but especially for internationals who are in the Netherlands for a limited time only! Furthermore, if you have someone with a little one over for a short period of time, we do also rent out cribs for a couple of weeks. Just contact us and we will let you know what we can do!
 
Annoyed with the big talks about reducing waste and little action, we felt that we had to do something ourselves in stead of keep standing on the sideline. Quickly we felt that if sustainability would ever reach the masses, it has to become affordable, convenient and fabulous. So we went ahead and did that, obviously :).
