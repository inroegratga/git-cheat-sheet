The material overlaps since the GUI simply wraps the scripts, although more detail can be found here since it is generated from the source itself.
 
Next, BWA maps the quality reads for each sample to the reference\_file given. reference\_fasta is a file of nucleic genome data in fasta format. This file may contain multiple references, such as the contigs in a draft genome. All reference names must match those located in the reference\_genbank file if an expression profile is to be generated. BWA will use threads number\_of\_cpu and mismatches to the reference given by allowed\_mismatches.

Then the SAM file produced by BWA is used with reference\_genbank to count reads over genic and intergenic loci. For a read to be used in further processing, it must have a MAPQ score (Phred-scale) of 37 or greater. This quality threshold corresponds to read being unique, where reads with duplicate mapping locations are ignored.
 
Briefly, reads in in\_fastq\_file are filtered for quality and separated by barcode by extract\_reads(), these results written to disk by write\_results(), and read counts are printed to stdout by print\_read\_counts() to be collected by the calling function.
 
The biologically relevant segment of the read is determined by the position given by bioseq\_start. This is a 1-based position, so for a barcode length of 4, using sample\_bioseq\_start of 5 means the read will be stored starting at the 5th nucleotide inthe read.
 
the total count for AAAA will be incremented, and if the quality is high, (ie, minimum base-wise quality score >= 20) the read will be added to the AAAA record andthe good count for AAAA will be incremented.
