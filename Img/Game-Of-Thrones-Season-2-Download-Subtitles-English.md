Hello,
 
I recently went through and transferred my GOT blu rays to my pc and needed the non-English subtitles when converting the raw files to mp4. I did not create the actual subtitle files for seasons 1-3. I corrected some timings and translations to make them the best that I could. I could not find the non-English part subtitles for seasons 4 and 5 so I had to make my own.
 
I had great difficulty finding quality subtitle files and like I said I even had to make my own for some of them. I just felt I should share my work so other people don't have to deal with the same struggle.
 
Also, if any of you find any mistake or that any of the timings are off (which they shouldn't be as I was very diligent and checked them all multiple times) please let me know and I will correct them and update the link.

The subtitles files should have all non-english parts. If there are any missing lines then they were missing from the actual live broadcast version of the show so I did not include them. I felt that they were meant to be mysterious and not have us know what they were saying. This happens occasionally and for the live version it would just say "(Speaks Dothraki)" or whatever language it would be in.
 
The subtitle files are in the .srt format. I am not sure how you would use them for a fire stick as I simply used them to burn in the subtitles to the actual video when I formatted the raw bluray files I ripped.
 
Hey yeah sorry my classes have started up again and I have been completely slammed with no time to work on them. Hopefully I should get to them over the next couple weeks (actually the next couple weeks this time though lol). I'm glad the subtitles worked well for you so far though!
 
Sorry guys, major apologies for the delay. This semester seriously kicked my ass. There were actually only 4 episodes with non English parts for season 7 but I like to be very thorough (watch once through and make note of parts that need subtitles, create and sync the subtitle files, and then watch again to make sure there aren't any I missed and that the ones I made are synced correctly) Big thanks to ryderR1 for providing the season 7 subtitles as well! They seem to be correct and complete! I combined the subs I had already done with the ones he/she provided and updated the mediafire link in my original post with the season 7 non English subs both in an individual file and added on to the complete zip as well. Enjoy! (And let me know if anyone finds any issues with them. Just to reiterate, they are synced with the US blu-ray rips).
 
i signed up JUST NOW AND DID THAT ONLY because the exceptionall kind of person you are to put in so much effort and attention to detail and aim for perfection .... and then SHARING YOUR WORK WITH THE WHOLE WORLD asking nothing in return

SO I COULD tell you that it deserves THANKS TIMES A ??? ... nope that's nolonger a suitable word so lets say it needs a new word in the dictionary for expressing a

"SUPERLATIVE OF THANKFULLNESS"
TO YOU 
and may life treat you as good as that in return

;oP

Hi, I just wanted to thank you for these! I am embedding them into mp4s. Random question or maybe not so much, would you happen to have a source for season 8 or made additional files for it? Thanks again!
 
The timings match up just fine - I added the subtitle file using Subler on my MacBook, I added the subs, not realising the download I'd sourced for the video had them burnt in, so I ended up with two sets on screen, then had to remove the subs I'd added. But for anyone without burnt in forced English subs on their copies - the above should do just fine.

I am anticipating the last season to be a blast but I wanted to retrace through the previous 7 seasons to be ready for the eighth one, just not in the traditional way. Pursuing Masters in Information Systems in NYC, commuting daily for 4 hours, 20 hours a week of part-time and managing home, I don't have that much time to watch all of 'em.
 
So, I pulled up a dataset of Game of Thrones English subtitles for all the 7 seasons through Kaggle. R, as a technology exposes a plethora of ways to analyze structured, unstructured data and transpose it to a more readable, understandable entity.
 
I was able to generate word clouds of the subtitles per season using R with the unigram approach. Seeing through the word clouds of every season in order, some of the major events came back to me and I was able to live through the show again. It was like the memories that I would re-live when I take a look at a really old picture of me with my friends.
 
'Lord' is the most common word through all the seasons and stands out in every cloud. But the progress of the story could be seen as the season approaches. Queen starts showing up as Daenerys starts growing her muscle and Cersei starts clearing people holding her up. 'winterfell' starts gaining more traction as seasons progresses and maxes out in the season with the Battle of the Bastards. 'dragon','dead' starts showing up more prominently during the 6th and 7th season.
 
Negative words with higher coefficient of violence start coming strong in the last two seasons. Using R to analyze this dataset is the fastest way that I could have used to brush up previous 7 seasons before the Eigth one starts.
