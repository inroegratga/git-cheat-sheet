My first order of business is to pan fry the tortillas in canola oil. (You only need to fill the pan around 1/4 inch deep, enough to cover the tortilla.) I let them get just a little brown and then place them on a paper towel. Add salt, pepper and a squeeze of lime.
 
Potatoes are key to successful huevos rancheros. I dice yukon golds and place into my cast iron skillet. I then add chopped onion and olive oil and saut until the onions are clear and then transfer the pan into an oven preheated to 400F. (Stir occasionally, add salt/pepper and olive oil as needed.)
 
Pop into the oven long enough for the cheese to become completely melted. Plate each tortilla stack and add another egg, sour cream and avocado. Garnish with a sprinkling of chili powder and/or some freshly chopped cilantro.
 
The Ranchero answered the call of buyers looking for a blend of car-like driving experience and styling with the utility of a pickup truck bed. This high-powered utility vehicle would have had no trouble passing tumbleweeds (and anything but a gas station) with its 370 HP 429 and 3.91 gears.

The 429 CJ motor and Ram Air hood apparently blew away some time ago. The seller offers a non-original motor and transmission, presumably at an additional cost. The perfect buyer might be someone who once owned a Twister Special, or always wanted one, or a local Ford dealer looking for showroom eye candy. That said, it would be a shame to restore this once-awesome blend of car and truck without letting it twist its tires into a smoky burnout once in a while. The optional hidden headlights would really put it over the top, but this interesting Ford is virtually unique as it sits. Who do you picture owning this Twister Special?
 
I know that I have seen at least one of these in my distant past! If I remember correctly the graphics were a twisting tornado down the sides on top of the white stripes! Maybe it was this one? Who knows, I lived and trucked across Kansas many years!
 
Nice rare car with a missing engine and hood. Where do they all go over time, to the engine and hood graveyard in the sky!! And there are a lot of RARE cars showing up. Nice cars for a little too much money. But still nice rare cars.
 
Original motor is the heart of the vehicle the rest is just sheet metal that is the same on every ranchero. Without the original motor I would not put much value in the car. Rather have the original motor where the real value lies and drop it in a well preserved Ford of any model.
