The bluefish fishery predominantly uses gillnets, but other gear includes hook and line, pound nets, seines, and trawls. The recreational fishery accounts for the majority of the bluefish total catch each year. The market for bluefish is for human consumption and is primarily sold fresh or smoked. U.S. wild-caught bluefish is a smart seafood choice because it is sustainably managed and responsibly harvested under U.S. regulations. Implementing regulations are found at 50 CFR part 648 subpart J.

Recreational fishermen use hook-and-line gear that has minimal impacts on habitat. Commercial fishermen use a variety of gears including trawls, gillnets, haul seines, and pound nets, and the impacts vary by gear type.
 
For all charter/party permit holders, VTRs must be maintained on board the vessel and submitted to NOAA Fisheries for all fishing trips, regardless of species retained. Instructions for completing the VTR can be found online on our reporting page.

Charter/Party vessel permit owners and operators with a federal charter/party (for-hire) permit to fish for bluefish (and other Mid-Atlantic species) must submit the required VTR by electronic means through a software application approved by NOAA Fisheries. These electronic log VTRs must be submitted within 48 hours after entering port at the conclusion of a trip. More information of the eVTR requirements and help with electronic reporting can be found online on our reporting page.
 
The recreational (charter/party) bluefish fishery does not have any Interactive Voice Response (IVR), Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), or specific observer requirements. However, all federally permitted vessels are obligated to carry an observer if randomly selected by the National Observer Program.
 
Reporting is not required for the private recreational fishery, but the Marine Recreational Information Program (MRIP) is a system of voluntary coordinated data collection programs designed to estimate recreational catch and effort.
 
There are no federal possession or fish size limit requirements in the commercial bluefish fishery. Please check with your state agency for any state or regional measures and requirements that may apply.
 
\*Quota may be transferred between states through in-season actions. These are the initial allocations and any changes may not be reflected in this table. Please check the quota monitoring page for updates.
 
Owners/operators of vessels holding a federal bluefish permit must submit VTRs electronically. For more information about trip reporting, and to see a list of approved eVTR software applications, please visit the Greater Atlantic Region vessel trip reporting page.

Bluefish are a good source of selenium, niacin, vitamin B12, magnesium, and potassium. As apex predators, bluefish can accumulate comparatively high levels of mercury and PCB contaminants. Limited consumption has been recommended in some states.
 
Atlantic Bluefish is managed in state and federal waters by the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, in conjunction with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. NOAA Fisheries serves as the implementing body for rules and regulations within the fishery.
 
The Atlantic Bluefish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) requires the specification of catch and harvest limits for up to three years at a time. If specifications are not in place at the start of the fishing year, the fishery functions without a quota until the final specifications of the current year are finalized.
 
The Bluefish FMP specifies that a transfer of quota is permitted between the commercial and recreational fisheries in either direction; based on a review and comparison of expected landings for each sector and the recreational harvest limit and commercial quota. The amount of quota transferred between fishery sectors may not exceed 10-percent of the Acceptable Biological Catch for that fishing year. No transfer may occur when the bluefish stock is overfished or subject to overfishing.
 
If the fishery-level ACL is exceeded, the total catch exceeds the ABC, or the total catch exceeds the OFL, and landings from the recreational fishery are determined to be the sole cause of the overage (and no sector transfer of allowable landings has occurred; see below), then a system of accountability measures will be used that are based on a combination of the amount of overage and the condition of the stock. In other words, the status of the stock determines what type of management response would be implemented, including adjustment of management measures, scaled payback of overage, or pound-for-pound overage payback. These adjustments will be made in the following fishing year, or as soon as possible, as a single year adjustment.
 
If the fishery-level ACL is exceeded and landings from the recreational fishery and/or the commercial fishery are determined to have caused the overage, and a transfer between the commercial and recreational sector has occurred for the fishing year, then the amount transferred between the recreational and commercial sectors may be reduced by the ACL overage amount (pound-for-pound repayment) in a subsequent, single fishing year if the Bluefish Monitoring Committee determines that the ACL overage was the result of too liberal a landings transfer between the two sectors. If the Bluefish Monitoring Committee determines that the ACL overage was not the result of the landings transfer, the recreational system of accountability measures, described above, will be implemented.
 
The bluefish management plan allows managers to set aside a small percentage of the annual catch limit for research. Proceeds from the sale of this set-aside catch are used to fund research on the fishery.
 
In 2012, managers established a coast-wide sampling program designed to improve the quantity and quality of information used in bluefish stock assessments. The program resulted in a significant increase in the amount of age-length keys and catch-at-age data that was used in future benchmark assessments.
 
Several key scientific gaps still need to be addressed to better inform bluefish management. For example, more research is needed on how much bluefish is caught and discarded in the commercial fisheries for bluefish and other species, the resulting impacts, and general population trends. There is also uncertainty in the methods used by scientists to monitor bluefish abundance and in estimating recreational catch along the Atlantic coast.

The MSC blue fish label means the product carrying it is made with wild-caught and certified sustainable seafood that meets the MSC Fisheries Standard, a set of requirements for sustainability that a fishery must prove they meet.
 
It's also designed to make it easy for seafood eaters to choose sustainably sourced seafood by making certified sustainable products easy to spot in the grocery store or on a menu. When you see the MSC blue fish label, you can be sure that seafood was sourced from sustainably managed fisheries that works hard to maintain healthy fish populations.
 
The MSC label reflects the most up-to-date understanding of internationally accepted fisheries science and management. It is reviewed and developed in consultation with scientists, the fishing industry, and conservation groups.
 
The **bluefish** (***Pomatomus saltatrix***) is the only extant species of the family Pomatomidae. It is a marine pelagic fish found around the world in temperate and subtropical waters, except for the northern Pacific Ocean. Bluefish are known as **tailor** in Australia and New Zealand,[5] **elf** and **shad** in South Africa.[6][7] It is a popular gamefish and food fish.
 
The bluefish is a moderately proportioned fish, with a broad, forked tail. The spiny first dorsal fin is normally folded back in a groove, as are its pectoral fins. Coloration is a grayish blue-green dorsally, fading to white on the lower sides and belly. Its single row of teeth in each jaw is uniform in size, knife-edged, and sharp. Bluefish commonly range in size from seven-inch (18-cm) "snappers" to much larger, sometimes weighing as much as 40 lb (18 kg), though fish heavier than 20 lb (9 kg) are exceptional.
 
The bluefish is the only extant species now included in the family Pomatomidae. At one time, gnomefishes were included, but these are now grouped in a separate family, Scombropidae. Extinct relatives of the bluefish include *Carangopsis* from the Early Eocene of Italy and *Lophar* from the Late Miocene of Northern California.
 
Bluefish are widely distributed around the world in tropical and subtropical waters. They are found in pelagic waters on much of the continental shelves along eastern America (though not between south Florida and northern South America), Africa, the Mediterranean and Black Seas (and during migration in between), Southeast Asia, and Australia. They are found in a variety of coastal habitats: above the continental shelf, in energetic waters near surf beaches, or by rock headlands.[8] They also enter estuaries and inhabit brackish waters.[9][10][11] Periodically, they leave the coasts and migrate in schools thr
