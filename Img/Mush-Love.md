Mush Love is a brand new arts experience set to premiere in Calgary, this July 29 and 30, 2023 at the beautiful Nvrlnd Arts Foundation, Boutique event space. Located in the historic neighbourhood of Ramsay/Inglewood, Mush Love aims to bring together Calgarians in celebration of the fabulous world of fungi and the magic of mushroom culture. The event is a dynamic and unique platform that combines an inclusive, group art exhibition with a mini-mushroom-inspired market by local creators, growers and educators.

Hi friends, this is Caitlin from Caitlin Annalee Cards and today I am sharing a sweet sneak peek of the new Mush Love Stamp set. I instantly fell in love with this little chunky mushroom image and I knew that I wanted it to be the focus of my card. I started by stamping it out 3 times with the Asphalt Ink and let them dry for a few minutes. While they were drying, I looked through my pattern papers and decided that the watercolor/tie dye blue/teal/purple paper from the **Butterfly Kisses Pattern Paper Pack**. I used that pattern paper to pick all of my Copic colors and colored each mushroom in one of the background colors. I love creating this almost tone on tone feel with the images coordinating so closely to the paper.
 
I used the coordinating dies to cut out the images and added some white gel pen highlights to them to bump up the cuteness. I trimmed down my pattern paper to be 5 in x 3.75 in and brought in a woven pattern back ground from the same paper pack for my first layer. I started out by adhering the woven paper to my side folding A2 card base with **EZ Squeeze Liquid Glue** and then added the watercolor pattern on top with liquid glue as well. I added **foam tape** to the back of all my mushrooms and before I removed the backing paper, I realized they needed something to stand on. I used a scrap from the woven pattern that I had trimmed off and glued that down flat to act as a little shelf.
 
I was finally ready to remove the backing paper and attach my mushrooms into place, in the same color order as the paper. Then I realized I wanted a sentiment so I grabbed the Hello stamp from the Mush Love Stamp set and stamped it onto the other scrap piece of the woven pattern with black ink. I adhered that flat underneath the images and I was torn about adding gems or enamel dots but I decided I wanted the mushrooms to be the main focus and decided to skip it this time. I love how this turned out and I hope you are excited to see all the goodness coming on Friday!!!!!
 
"When you first feel crazy in love, you are stressed out about it and lots of cortisol, the stress hormone, is secreted," said Dr. Jacquie Olds, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School in Boston. "It's at a high level when you're worried that you're falling in love and don't know if it will work out. It's what makes you feel preoccupied and obsessed, almost like it's a matter of life and death."
 
Phenylethylamine is the hormone-like substance produced at the early stages of attraction that provokes the dizzy sensation some people feel when they're falling in love. It triggers the release of norepinephrine, which helps the body respond to stress, and dopamine, "the joy and reward chemical," Olds said.
 
Dopamine also triggers the release of testosterone in men, increasing feelings of arousal and suppressing serotonin, which can lead to more aggressive behavior. In women, the release of estrogen likewise stimulates a higher libido.
 
Oxytocin, sometimes called the "love hormone," is released during sexual activity and is what makes you feel bonded to the object of your desire, said Dr. Philip Stieg, neurosurgeon in chief at New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center and director of the Weill Cornell Medicine Brain and Spine Center in New York City.
 
"The brain is hard-wired for love. All the connections are there, but the software is variable between individuals," he said. For example, "a dopamine-rich person is willing to take risks. The serotonin-rich person is more cautious about relationships."
 
"If you're not as happy and you are stressed by unrequited love, cortisol is released," Stieg said. "Epinephrine is released. This increases the inflammatory response. The heart rate goes up and blood pressure goes up. There's less serotonin and you can become depressed. This can hurt your diet and your sleep cycle."
 
And when love dies? "It's astonishing what a huge deal that is for one's body and mind," Olds said. "It's just the same as losing somebody from death, or even slightly worse because the other person has decided not to be with you. Whether you are on the receiving end or not, breaking up can be like a mini-depression because it's such a massive change."
 
That's harmful to health in several ways, she said. In addition to the stress of losing someone, "it also gets in the way of the motivation to do things that are good for you." For example, it might cause stress eating of unhealthy foods or reduce the motivation to exercise.
