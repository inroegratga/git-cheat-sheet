It is intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of a piece of the system, i.e., test target. Usually, every requirement or objective the test target is expected to achieve needs at least one Test. The success of the Test is determined by comparing expected and actual results. In Xray, a Test case is an issue. You can create Tests just like creating any other issue in Jira.
 
**Manual** Tests are manually executed by testers without using any automation tools. It requires a tester to play the role of an end-user whereby they use most of the application's features to ensure correct behavior. Usually, manual Tests are defined with a Test script that users must follow in order to assert the expected functionality. The Test script can be organized in steps where each step has the action and expected result. Other types of manual Tests (e.g. Exploratory Tests) do not have any structure or even a Test script.

**Automated** Tests are executed through an external tool which controls the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes to predicted outcomes. They can automate some repetitive tasks in a formalized testing process already in place, or add additional testing that would be difficult to perform manually.
 
It is possible to define additional Test Types in the Xray custom field. In Xray's administration, you may add other values for the "Test Type" custom field (see list below). For example, you may want to differentiate automated tests that may exist simultaneously in a project.
 
In the same way, although **Cucumber** Tests were designed to be automated Tests, these can also be executed manually within Xray. In fact, this is a usual pattern for defining Tests using a domain-specific language that can later be automated.
 
**Unstructured or Generic**Test Types in Xray can also be used for manual or automated Tests. When importing execution results from frameworks other than Cucumber/Gherkin, Xray will do the auto-provisioning of Tests by creating **generic** Tests. Another example of **Unstructured** Tests is **Exploratory** Tests. You can create a custom Test Type named "**Exploratory**" that Xray will map by default to the **Unstructured** Test Type. An Exploratory Test is also a manual Test because the execution will be driven by the testers and not by a machine.
 
Within the **Test Details** web panel, users will be presented with a different UI and fields based on the Test Type. The Test Type field can also be changed inline. Please refer to following pages for more details for each Test Type:

When you do this, you'll have a dynamic coverage of the requirement based on the Tests belonging to the Test Set. That mean that you can then add or remove Tests to/from the Test Set and they will be covering the requirement or not depending on being or not on the Test Set.
 
Xray Test issues can be exported to XML. This export differs from the Jira default action for exporting to XML. Rather than exporting all fields, the Xray export action will only export to XML the most relevant fields for Tests, such as the Test definition fields, Pre-Conditions and some issue-tracking information.
 
This web panel displays a data-table with all the Pre-Condition issues associated with the current Test. You can also create new Pre-Conditions, associate existing Pre-Condition issues, and remove the association between the Test and Pre-Conditions. It is possible to preview each Pre-Condition definition by clicking on the preview button for each data-table row.
 
This web panel displays a data-table with all the Test Set issues associated with the current Test. You can also add the current Test issue to other Test Set issues, and remove the association between existing Test Sets.
 
Xray provides the ability to configure columns for the Test Sets table. This configuration is specific to each user and can be restored to the default configuration defined in the Default columns layout page in Xray app administration.
 
Xray provides the ability to configure columns for the Test Plans table. This configuration is specific to each user and can be restored to the default configuration defined in the Default columns layout page in Xray app administration.
 
The Test Runs web panel displays a data-table with all executions for the current Test. From this panel, you can filter the Test Runs, create new ad-hoc executions, and create new executions for existing Test Execution issues.
 
Hi all.
We are trying to export from Xray (we have a few hundreds tests) but fail.
the tutorial point to use the app better excel
or export instructions
But both depend on a **custom field ("Manual Test steps")**Which do not exists on our Jira.

We have Jira cloud and xray, and all searches lead to dead ends.
What to do when the **"Manual Test steps" isn't exists?**
 
In addition, on your subject of this post you are saying that you want to import the tests, but on your actual question you say that you are trying to export the tests. So, if I may ask, what is your goal? Export the tests from server and import them to cloud?
 
Ever wanted to have a simple way to manage quality assurance tests which integrates seamlessly with Jira? Now, you can do it easily with Xray. It supports both manual and automated tests and provides useful reports to track the quality and requirement coverage of your projects.
 
Our aim is to help you improve the quality of your systems through effective and efficient testing. That's why from our first version, Xray already supports both manual and automated tests, including full support for Cucumber tests in the native language (i.e., English).
 
A traditional, manual test involves a sequence of steps coupled with conditions or variables, test inputs, and expected results. It is intended to establish the quality, performance, and/or reliability of a piece within a system.
 
The test set is a simple way to create different groups of tests, since it is a flat list of tests. You may have as many test sets as you wish and a test may be included in multiple test sets. Test sets are ideal if you want to have full control over certain groups of tests.
 
The test repository is a tree-like organizational structure at the project level. It allows you to hierarchically organize tests within folders and sub-folders. This folder concept is common in some tools and resembles file organization in a computer's operating system.
 
Test planning allows you to decide your **testing strategy**, including the issues you want to validate, how to validate them, if tests will be manual or automated, how resources will be allocated, and when and who will execute the tests.
 
A test execution is an issue type that aggregates a user-determined collection of tests. It monitors and verifies if tests work as expected in a target context and environment. The overall execution status, updated after each test is performed, informs you about the progress of the test execution, including which tests passed, failed, are being executed, or are waiting to be performed.

He works closely with many different teams worldwide to help them achieve great, high-quality, testable products. He believes that by understanding how organizations work, processes and quality can be improved while development and testing can "merge" and act as a unique team, with a common goal: provide the best product that stakeholders need.
 
The AWS X-Ray SDK (the SDK) allows developers to instrument their web applicationsto automatically record information for incoming and outgoingrequests and responses. It can also record local datasuch as function calls, time, variables (via metadata and annotations), and AmazonEC2, ECS, and Elastic Beanstalk metadata (via plugins). Currently, Express and Restifyapplications are supported for automatic capturing via middleware. AWS Lambda functions can also be instrumented.
 
Automatic mode is designed for use with Express, Restify, and Lambdaapplications, but can be used outside of such applications.For more information about developing your own middleware or using automatic mode without middleware, see the developing custom solutionsusing automatic mode section below.
 
Automatic mode uses the cls-hooked package and automatically tracksthe current segment or subsegment when using the built-in capture functions or anyof the aws-xray-sdk modules. Using the built-in capture functions or other aws-xray-sdk modules automatically createsnew subsegments to capture additional data and update the current segment or subsegment on that context.
 
By default, the SDK expects the daemon to be at 127.0.0.1 (localhost) on port 2000. You can override the address for both UDP and TCP.You can change this via the environment variables listed above, or through code. The same format applies to both.
 
By default the SDK will log error messages to the console using the standard methods on the console object. The loglevel of the built in logger can be set bu using either the AWS\_XRAY\_DEBUG\_MODE or AWS\_XRAY\_LOG\_LEVEL environmentvariables.
 
If AWS\_XRAY\_DEBUG\_MODE is set to a truthy value, e.g. true, then the log level will be set to debug. IfAWS\_XRAY\_DEBUG\_MODE is not set then AWS\_XRAY\_LOG\_LEVEL will be used to determine the log level. This variable canbe set to either debug, info, warn, error or silent. Be warned if the log level is set to silent then NO logmessages will be produced. The default log level is error and this will be used if neither environment variableis set or if an invalid level is specifie
