With this introduction, we will proceed with the translation for mudhal thiuvandhAdhi. The commentary for this prabandham has been written by nampiLLai and by periyavAchchAn piLLai (which has been explained by appiLLai, one of the ashtadhik gajangaLs of maNavALa mAmunigaL).

In the previous article ( -jiyar/) we discussed about ponnadikkAl jIyar. We will now continue on with other AzhwArs and AchAryas. In this article we will discuss the vaibhavam of mudhalAzhwArgaL (poigaiyAr, bhUthathAr, peyAr).

When they were sharing their divine anubhavams, emperumAn with his thirumAmagaL suddenly entered the shed where it was very dark. Wanting to see who arrived,
 
Simple translation:
These 3 AzhwArs appeared before the other 7 AzhwArs and benedicted the world with their divine thamizh pAsurams. It is because of this glorious act they became to be popularly known as mudhalAzhwArgaL.

Just as vEdham became known by the recitors as in AtharvaNam etc, these prabandhams also icame to be known as composed by SatakOpa.
