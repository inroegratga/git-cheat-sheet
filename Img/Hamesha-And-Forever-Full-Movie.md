Source brought us together,and source separated us
but my love is strong as it vibes in my heart.
Your smile there makes me smile here,
you been happy there makes me feel happy here,
I remember those touches and when I think my body shivers still,
so see you are in me ,with me even when we are apart,
no voice can I ever hear as sweeter as yours,
no face can I see ever as beautiful as yours,
You use to say the sweetest words I ever heard,
you showed me a reason to love myself,
you gave me love from heart and I am grateful forever,
you are in my mind always ,you are in every breath I take,
you own every inch of me
Someone like you I know I can never meet,
thus I will keep loving you till eternity.
