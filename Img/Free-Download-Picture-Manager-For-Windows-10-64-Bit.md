Okay, so I'm the last one using Office 2003 and don't have the discs or activation code anymore. Suddenly my 'collage' feature in my picture manager only allows me to print one photo/page. Office 2003 does have a Repair feature but, again, no discs or activation code so no help there. Any work-arounds anyone know about? I'm old school and an occational user of this 'collage' feature. Grateful for any assitance.

During the course of years, numerous companies have created various software solutions for image editing. While some tools are extremely professional and offer an abundance of features, there are those with limited features that are simple to use and get the job done.
 
One such tool is the Microsoft Office Picture Manager. It includes a lot of useful features that will allow you to quickly edit a picture and make use of it. If you are interested in using this software tool, you have come to the right place. In this text, you are going to learn the following.
 
If you are in need of a software that will quickly allow you to make some changes to a photo, MOPM is a great option for you. It is equipped with plenty of useful features that make it a very useful tool.

Like all the other Microsoft apps, the MOPM comes with different available menus and toolbars. It is also equipped with several task panes, a shortcut pane. You can make the whole picture editing process quicker by learning all of the available keyboard shortcuts.
 
Once you are finished with the image editing process, you can choose to either rename and save the image, overwrite the original image, discard the changes, export it to another location. Furthermore, you can add the image to the SharePoint library, attach the image to an email or share it with a private network or an intranet.
 
Microsoft is a company with a long history. Throughout the years, it has both implemented and excluded numerous software tools. Microsoft Office Picture Manager is one of the older tools that was implemented all the way back in 2003. It was first known as Picture Library.
 
It was a standard part of the Office 2003 suite and it was a part of it all up to Office 2010. In this time span, the software tool has matured plenty and it became a part of SharePoint Designer 2007. Even though the Microsft Office Picture Manager is no longer available with the Office 2013, 2016, and 2019 iterations, it is still possible to install it as a standalone application.
 
In comparison to Microsoft Office Picture Manager, Microsoft Photos packs more features and it is blended with Microsoft Paint 3D. It is simply a more recent software tool that Microsoft is actively working on improving. However, Microsoft Office Picture Manager has an advantage when it comes to batch image processing.
 
By relying on these two standard Windows 10 picture managers, you can easily make adjustments to your favorite images. But as previously mentioned, Microsoft Office Picture Manager is more suitable for making batch edits to a set of images.
 
On the other hand, there are those that are based on the freemium business model, meaning that not all of the features are available with the free version, but if you make a purchase, you get to unlock the rest of the features.
 
It is obvious that there are plenty of Microsoft Office Picture Manager alternatives. Picking the right one will solely depend on your image editing needs. If you are looking for a way to quickly edit an image in a minute or two, practically any free editing software will meet your demands.
 
However, if you require constant editing of numerous images, the PhotoHandler is an interesting solution that will most likely meet your needs. You can either pick that one or choose one of the freemium or premium solutions.
 
But if you liked Picture Manager, and its features are all you need, you can install it on your computer without uninstalling your current version of Office. You can install Picture Manager from an Office 2010, 2007, or 2003 installation disc if you have one. If not, you can download SharePoint Designer 2010 and install it from there.
 
The Microsoft Office Picture Manager may not have all the bells and whistles available in modern photo management tools. Still, if it has everything you need, you can install it and use it to manage your photos and pictures.
 
SharePoint Designer 2010 was the last version that included Picture Manager. You should save the installation file if you need to reinstall it or install it on another computer. Who knows for how long it will be available from Microsoft?
 
Brilliant, thanks! Picture Manager (and also the similarly removed Movie Maker) are so much easier to use and with more features than the horrible Metro style replacements. I have Photoshop but PM is just so much easier for simple editing tasks. I use it all the time for the resize function for which MS Photos is useless.
 
Thank you. Your step by step was totally helpful. I kept this page open next to the installation as I completed each step. Perfect! I have Microsoft Office Picture Manager back and I love it. This is great.
 
After I have Office Picture Manager on my computer do I have to keep Office Share point Designer 2010? I am getting a awful lot of updates offered by Windows update that seems to think I have Office 2010 on my computer. Can Office Picture Manager work without Office Share Point it was taken from? I would like to uninstall Office SharePoint 2010 from Programs and Features.
 
Well I uninstalled Office SharePoint 2010 and sure enough Office Picture Manager went with it. I had hoped that would not happen; that maybe picture manager would stand alone. I think I will give it up because to keep it means installing, at this point, 55 more updates for Office 2010 on top of the 3 I did download/install. (All three uninstalled with SharePoint and Picture Manager.) So I seem to be clean of Office 2010 updates and SharePoint 2010. Disappointed about loosing Picture Manager. Oh well.
 
I think you have disappointed everyone when you took away the MS Picture Manager. It works easy and great for small jobs. Resizing photos for word document and fixing the color to print on regular paper. Put it back is a request.
