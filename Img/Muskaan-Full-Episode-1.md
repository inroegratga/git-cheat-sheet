The recently revealed new promo of Bigg Boss Malayalam Season 6 confirmed that the show is set to have yet another elimination, today (June 2, 2024). Among the 9 remaining contestants, Jasmin Jaffar, Sreethu Krishnan, Abhishek Sreekumar, Sai Krishna, Norah Muskaan, and Rishi S Kumar were nominated for the evictions this time. However, later it was revealed that Jasmin, Sreethu, Abhishek, and Sai are seen receiving green sash ribbons, which indicate that they are saved from elimination this time.
 
However, both Rishi and Norah entered the danger zone after Bigg Boss sent them two bigger boxes, which they were asked to open together. While the young actor opened his box nervously, the popular influencer is seen smiling as she opened her box, in the new BBMS6 promo video. Now, some unconfirmed reports suggest that Rishi S Kumar has been saved from the eliminations this week, while Noraah Muskaan bid goodbye to the show. However, we will have to wait for the episode, to know the results.
