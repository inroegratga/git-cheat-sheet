**What are the benefits of using ePUB, Mobi?**
The epub book can maintain compatibility with any device. Do not need to zoom in while reading the book. These formats can adjust automatically for small or large screen devices and there is no problem with screen size.
Text can be copied from the book and can be shared wherever you want.
The text font size can be changed, font color can be changed and even you can change the background color of the book.
These types of files are used in very low space (Mb), so we can store a lot of books in a low space.
Readers who are suffering from visual problems mean blurred vision or face problems reading small text, for their epub is a groundbreaking solution for them.
You can mark a likable line and comments can be added. You can bookmark a specific page. And many more facilities.
 
Thanks a lot for the books. But I cannot read the mobi files using my kindle app. The books are recognized by kindle but when I open then I see boxes instead of letters. Can anyone suggest me how to solve this.

I have modified the files I downloaded from this website and created new pdf and epub files of Taranath Tantrik with the missing text and pages.
Would you re-upload them here?
How do I send them to you?
