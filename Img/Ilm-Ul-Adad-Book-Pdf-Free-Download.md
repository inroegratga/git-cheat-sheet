Though originating in northern Mesopotamia, Adad was identified by the same Sumerogram dIM that designated Iškur in the south.[14] His worship became widespread in Mesopotamia after the First Babylonian dynasty.[15] A text dating from the reign of Ur-Ninurta characterizes the two sides of Adad/Iškur as threatening in his stormy rage, and benevolent in giving life.[16]

**Iškur** appears in the list of gods found at Shuruppak but was of far less importance, perhaps because storms and rain were scarce in Sumer and agriculture there depended on irrigation instead. The gods Enlil and Ninurta also had storm god features that diminished Iškur's distinct role, and he sometimes appears as the assistant or companion of these more prominent gods.
 
When Enki distributed the destinies, he made Iškur inspector of the cosmos. In one litany, Iškur is proclaimed again and again as "great radiant bull, your name is heaven" and also called son of Anu, lord of Karkara; twin-brother of Enki, lord of abundance, lord who rides the storm, lion of heaven.
 
Adad/Iškur's consort (both in early Sumerian and the much later Assyrian texts) was the grain goddess Shala, who is also sometimes associated with the god Dagānu. She was also called *Gubarra* in the earliest texts. The fire god Gibil (Girra in Akkadian) is sometimes the son of Iškur and Shala.
 
He is identified with the Anatolian storm-god Teshub, whom the Mitannians designated with the same Sumerogram dIM.[8] Occasionally he is identified with the Amorite god Amurru.[*citation needed*]
 
Adad/Iškur presents two aspects in hymns, incantations, and votive inscriptions. On the one hand, he brings rain in due season to fertilize the land; on the other, he sends storms to wreak havoc and destruction. He is pictured on monuments and cylinder seals (sometimes with a horned helmet) with the lightning and the thunderbolt (sometimes in the form of a spear), and in hymns his sombre aspects predominate. His association with the sun-god Shamash, with the two deities alternating in the control of nature, tends to imbue him with some traits of a solar deity.

According to Alberto Green, descriptions of Adad starting in the Kassite period and in the region of Mari emphasize his destructive, stormy character and his role as a fearsome warrior deity,[19] in contrast to Iškur's more peaceful and pastoral character.[20]
 
Shamash and Adad jointly became the gods of oracles and divination, invoked in all the ceremonies to determine the divine will: through inspecting a sacrificial animal's liver, the action of oil bubbles in a basin of water, or the movements of the heavenly bodies. They are similarly addressed in royal annals and votive inscriptions as *bele biri* (lords of divination).
 
In the second millennium BCE, the king of Yamhad or Halab (modern Aleppo), who claimed to be "beloved of Hadad", received the tribute of statue of Ishtar from the king of Mari, to be displayed in the temple of Hadad in Halab Citadel.[23][24] Hadad is called "the god of Aleppo" on a stele of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser I.
 
The element *Hadad* appears in a number of theophoric names borne by kings of the region. Hadad son of Bedad, who defeated the Midianites in Moab, was the fourth king of Edom. Hadadezer ("Hadad-is-help") was the Aramean king defeated by David. Later Aramean kings of Damascus seem to have habitually assumed the title of Ben-Hadad (son of Hadad). One was Ben-Hadad, the king of Aram whom the Judean king Asa sent to invade the northern Kingdom of Israel.[25] A votive basalt stele from the 9th or 8th century, BCE found in Bredsh north of Aleppo, is dedicated to Melqart and bears the name Ben-Hadad, king of Aram.[26] The seventh of the twelve sons of Ishmael is also named Hadad.
 
A set of related bynames include Aramaic rmn, Old South Arabic rmn, Hebrew rmwn, and Akkadian Rammānu ("Thunderer"), presumably originally vocalized as *Ramān* in Aramaic and Hebrew. The Hebrew spelling rmwn with Masoretic vocalization *Rimmn*[27] is identical with the Hebrew word meaning 'pomegranate' and may be an intentional misspelling and parody of the original.
 
The word *Hadad-rimmon* (or *Hadar-rimmon*) in the phrase "the mourning of (or at) Hadad-rimmon",[28] has aroused much discussion. According to Jerome and the older Christian interpreters, the mourning is for something that occurred at a place called Hadad-rimmon (*Maximianopolis*) in the valley of Megiddo. This event was generally held to be the death of Josiah (or, as in the Targum, the death of Ahab at the hands of Hadadrimmon). But even before the discovery of the Ugaritic texts, some suspected that Hadad-rimmon might be a dying-and-rising god like Adonis or Tammuz, perhaps even the same as Tammuz, and the allusion could then be to mournings for Hadad such as those of Adonis festivals.[29] T. K. Cheyne pointed out that the Septuagint reads simply Rimmon, and argues that this may be a corruption of Migdon (Megiddo) and ultimately of Tammuz-Adon. He would render the verse, "In that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of the women who weep for Tammuz-Adon" (*Adon* means "lord").[30] No further evidence has come to light to resolve such speculations.
 
In Sanchuniathon's account Hadad is once called Adodos, but is mostly named Demars. This is a puzzling form, probably from Ugaritic dmrn, which appears in parallelism with Hadad,[32] or possibly a Greek corruption of *Hadad Ramān*. Sanchuniathon's Hadad is son of Sky by a concubine who is then given to the god Dagon while she is pregnant by Sky. This appears to be an attempt to combine two accounts of Hadad's parentage, one of which is the Ugaritic tradition that Hadad was son of Dagon.[33] The cognate Akkadian god Adad is also often called the son of Anu ("Sky"). The corresponding Hittite god Teshub is likewise son of Anu (after a fashion).
 
In Sanchuniathon's account, it is Sky who first fights against Pontus ("Sea"). Then Sky allies himself with Hadad. Hadad takes over the conflict but is defeated, at which point unfortunately no more is said of this matter. Sanchuniathion agrees with Ugaritic tradition in making Muth, the Ugaritic Mot, whom he also calls "Death", the son of El.
 
**Ive been trying to join for adad since 8,0 because i have a quest, i dont need loot at all(im a f2p player) - but since im not a "known" player in a "known" legion im not "allowed" to join to kill adad and leave.**

Do i get that they kick people because they aren't in the "self proclaimed list of known players"? No, i dont know anyone of them, so not at all. 

If they aint making these things easier to join, make adad and agent A LOT harder so they have to invite people....again. 

**Is the loot really that important for the**"top players"**at this moment in aion? I doubt that very much, because its the "top players" that are the only ones who are invited.**
 
Or just add some rewards that everyone gets, regardless if they get the kill or not. Like 3 random apostle fragments per player of the winning faction, 1 for the losing one? (you know, the ones whose source was lost for due to dred removal) Just add an NPC to buy it like agent in Inggison / Gelkmaros, make it 1 exp insignia per fragment, limited to 3/1 depending on win/lose. That way, ppl can still build their alliances the way they want and compete for the agent's loot, and it still is attractive for every player. Right now, only certain Elyos and no Asmodians even show to those fights, it's stupid.
 
Was asked for multiple times by tonnes of people. And that's what is toxic about this game, is the sheer greed of elitest players in this game, backed up by gameforge staff who have no interest in balancing the game out. The fact that there are a few of those people who should have recieved multiple life time bans, yet are still here, says they probably are the same people
 
Root cause is no competition for top elyos players since race balance is joke on EU servers. Why top elyos players should invite anyone to share free stuff? Asking for some rewards that everyone gets or better rewards is more retarded idea. Drop should be removed from Adad and Agent, only quests should be available.
 
There is no interest in trying to balance factions (there has never been any incentives such as resources given to try and get people to play on the weaker faction) Other servers gave like 100 free race transfers and stuff (I'd be happy if everyone on asmo side got given a xform candy every single day, if it expires within say 4hrs of accepting it) plus higher AP, enchants, etc.
 
That's entirely my point, they are enabling this to happen, and as producers for the game you are well within your rights to ask for these changes, that have been asked for by the playerbase. It's not exactly like they have to code these mechanics from scratch....it already exists in the game code. it was asked for Day 1 of apsharanta arriving.
 
Put incentives for playing weaker factions, give them free stuff, give boost events only for 1 side, put hero trials with better rewards for weaker faction, give exclusive skins, pets, mounts. Give pvp jams, xform candies. There are plenty of ways to incentivize people...
