**Mouse Recorder Pro 2** is a free mouse and keyboard recording application which will record your computer mouse and keyboard input, allowing you to repeat an operation easily and fast.This program allows you to easily play the recorded steps made when installing or working with a certain application. You are also able to edit and set the repeat time of your recordings.You can play what you have been recording in a scheduled time you set. You are able to edit what you have been recording for further development.
 
This could easily done by an mouse recorder, but unfortunately I am not able to download anything. I have PowerShell preinstalled on my computer, so this could be an option (I've used this successfully in the past for making directories).
 
Comparably, I achieve what you seek with Windows PowerShell ISE, which needs not the hassle of having to d/l & instal: open a blank project in **PowerShell ISE** and add the following code...
 
Create an array by calling in user32.dll & calling the mouse clicking event within. **Note: this is important if you wish to send mouse-clicking events**. Without this, your mouse will just keep on changing its position but won't click anywhere. (More information can be found here.)
 
In above command you are simply getting cursor X & Y Position. Please note, you may have to perform this steps for more times to get the mouse pixels, as in where you want your mouse cursor to go and click.

GhostMouse - never received a ban and ive used it a fuck ton. You can also get reMouse or something that repeats your mouse recording for as long as u want but u have to pay for that, i just set up an autoclicker on the play button of GhostMouse.
 
Only got banned once, probably because i did like 1-85 fletching in a weekend . Mostly used it on an rsps so i cant really comment on bans. I did 1-89 cooking in f2p and some agility on my main, both with no ban.
 
You can pretty much do anything it just takes time to make the recordings. 2 hours of making different cooking recordings and you can use that all the way to 99. That being said I've got an account to 90+ combats 90 cooking, 90 fletching, etc
 
I used Mouse and keyboard reocder for more than 300m exp in diffrent skills..only ban i received was when i used 1h record for 26m cooking exp...use it smart and your gona be safe, you can check my thread project on my profile about that.
 
Nice progress mate Tho babysit part is not very attractive maybe if you have your mouse free in the meanwhile. Did you? I mean when you have your recording on is your pc unusable or did you use Virtual Machines or something?
 
I got a 2 day, but that was while using a rune mate bot for iron in the mining guild. The day before I was 2 dayed I accidentally let it run 12 hours straight, no breaks, on a 2k total world. So that was totally my fault. That was before I even knew about mouse recording.

 
Can you help me set up the hunter auto click? Or did you use a mouse recorder and babysit? I'm trying to get an autoclicker going for maniacal monkeys if you'd be so kind to help me out with the 4 required scripts
 
wc is one clickable, ive done it with simple macros on razer synapse, though my "script" is extremely primitive. theres two teaks in priff that you can turn your cam a certain way and chop them both without moving the mouse. all i did was do a left click then hotkey to pull up invy then shift click to drop the log, then click again on the tree, if your tree falls then it clicks the other. you can be crashed but if you get the right angle on the camera you can have it not click on a tile except your own so even if both teaks are resetting you wont move. this was a method i used to farm crystal shards since its in priff. the only thing id say is babysit it every so often as you can stack up a full inv and then your hourly xp drops, all you need to do is move your mouse while the shift part of the script, and click fast to drop as many logs as you can before the trees are clicked again. i just cba to sit and click manually so much on these grindy skills. as a kid maybe, as an adult, aint got time for it.
 
I've had a macro recorder record teleporting before where I had recorded 120 minutes of me training myself and that seemed to be working just fine too. I've used the same method for glassblowing and different other skills where you basically only have to bank your inventory. (Herblore, Crafting, Cooking, Fletching)
 
Case differs from person to person. Once upon a time tooth fairy managed to get to 99 fishing on 10x accounts without bans any bans, while poor @lonewolfff got banned using the same script while getting his 40 fishing to get his hands on delicious lobsters.
 
Thanks for the helpful response man, I know anything is possible but lets face it, Letting a script run for 10 hours while your at work/school is way more risky than running a mouse recorder and sitting by your screen, talking to friends and just being AFK. im just wanting to avoid the click intensive crap. You ever used it for construction? My only problem is the damn butler spawns in different spots -\_-
 
You can be banned mouse recording but if you stick to simple things and do it right ban rate should be significantly lower than normal botting or generic auto clicker. Theres a lot of options. I use the one at mouserecorder .com. You can use it free it just occasionally tells me im using premium features when my script ends but doesnt make me pay. I've found I can loop a 1+ hour recording until 99, you could make more recordings than that to be safe.
 
The important thing about this program is it has an editor with pixel detection (its not the only one with pixel detection but most of the others dont). This means you can add check spots and if it doesnt match it kills the macro. Aka. You lagged and clicked away from the bank instead of clicking on the item in the bank. And now run in circles until u get banned. This program generally generally has an issue here and there that you need to fix in the editor, where ghost mouse and others are fine from the start. But pixel detection is really important if you dont babysit your macro. It might take a bit to get it working well but when it does it works well.
 
I have actually recently became an expert at mouse recording and I am able to let mine run for 12 hours if I want without getting ban. I've also come back to it messed up and had people call me bot and got reported and didnt get ban lol soooo idk
