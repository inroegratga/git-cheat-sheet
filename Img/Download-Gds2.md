Does the gds2+tech2win have the can diag function? Or is it only on the gds2 subscription? Also if you have used it, is it live? Also the amount of times I could have used the can tool, can you already have the tech2win gds2 package andthen get a 3 day pass onlyfor the can tool, on the same laptop? (I knowyou can'thave ids and fjds,is it similar)

Hi i have a corvette 2019 Grand Sport and all installations is ok gds2+deliverable 2024 i put my key at on after choosing my year and car, but i cant continue the button continue still grey? is there a lockup in that model or what? thank you
 

Yeah, you don't have a connection with your car. Either you're choosing wrong VCI from the list, or it is not seen by GDS2 at all.

You don't have to choose year/model - GDS2 should read VIN and decodes it automatically.

It would tell you in red letters - "NO VALID LEASE FOUND", if it was a license activation issue.. 
If I remember correct, he would not be able to open "Diagnostics" tab without a valid lease too.

But posting a screenshot of GDS2 main screen would help to answer some questions, for sure..
