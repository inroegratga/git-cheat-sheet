Kairo are a single-use heat pack that you activate when you are ready to use it and they stay hot for at least 8 hours, some brands up to 15 hours. You pop them into your pockets to keep your hands warm or attach them to your clothing such as an undershirt to provide heat around the body core and lumbar area. They are extremely toasty and comfortable to use.
 
As far as I can tell the extensive use of this form of a heating pad to keep warm is fairly unique to Japan but it turns out that they are useful for any cold-weather sports or activities and also beneficial for arthritis or other injuries that are effectively treated or managed with heat.

I found the kairo in a versatile rectangular shape initially and these are great to add inside clothes where you feel the cold most. The heat packs now come in a variety of different forms too. There is a longer butterfly shape that is suggested for shoulder pain but also works well on the lower back for discomfort or warmth on the sacrum area.
 
The kairo package contains iron filings, water, vermiculite, carbon and salt. When exposed to air the iron oxidises and heats up over a period of about 10 minutes, it then stays hot for around 12 hours. Only open the packet when you are ready to use it.
 
The sticky side goes onto your clothes not directly on your skin, this avoids any issue of skin allergies or reactions to the adhesive. They are best used on a thin layer of fitted clothing such as a singlet top so they stay firmly in place and you get the maximum warmth. I use them in cold climates attached to superfine merino wool camisoles or technical fabrics which are quite delicate and the adhesive has always come off cleanly without any damage or stretching.
 
While they are designed to be a single-use, recyclable product there is an instance where you can and might want to reuse them. I have been told that if you only need to use it for a couple of hours you can stop the oxidisation (and heat) by placing it inside a sealed airtight plastic bag like a ziplock bag until the following day.
 
As mentioned the packs can be fully recycled with the contents being added to the garden or pot plants and the paper out recycled. If you prefer to reuse than recycle the sachets include activated charcoal which will absorb odours so they can be tucked into shoes in your cupboard to freshen them up between uses.
 
In Sapporo in winter these were for sale pretty much everywhere, pharmacies, discount stores and train stations were easy places to find them as they were prominently placed. I imagine the snow festival is an optimal sales time for them.
 
Thanks for letting me know, Dann. I've contacted them to see if they can share a new code for readers or reactivate it, I'll update the article in the next week either way and let you know if a discount code becomes available again. Have a good weekend.

Hi Ann, the safety directions around not using heat pads while pregnant or on babies and young children comes from the manufacturer's instructions. Medical practitioners warn pregnant women against raising body temperature artificially such as using hot pools and electric blankets. Young children can't say if they are too hot and their bodies don't regulate their body temperature as quickly putting them at risk from overheating.
 
I understand looking at ways to keep warm travelling into Japans late autumn / early winter from a tropical country. If you are around the bigger cities like Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka you may not find it too cold yet, we were there at a similar time for autumn leaves last year and dressing in layers was sufficient although I definitely wanted a scarf and gloves a few evenings. It's a great time of year to walk around at night with the winter light-ups starting.
 
There is ones called Hot Hands in Australia aswell. Same thing carcoal.Cost me about $2 for a pack off 2.Lasted a whole night. They get hotter if kept in a pocket but cooled down abit once taken out of pocket. But just keep in pockets and no issue.I bought them to keep warm at a party and used them to help my jaw pain.
 
i also found when I bought the hot packs overseas then brought them home, they were not as effective. also i've found issues with Daiso hot packs bought outside Japan. they did not work at all when i was going to use them. glad to know that the one sold in japan and used directly works their magic coz i'm going there this February
 
Hi Jen, I have used them more frequently outside Japan now and found some work well, if it's not really cold and you're using them for aches and pains they don't feel warm to the hand but they do infuse their heat into the area they are in contact with and give long-lasting relief. In the colder parts of Japan in winter I've worn them on my underlayer, usually a very fine marino wool camisole or delicate heat-tec fabrics and they haven't done any harm on either of those, no sticky residue or pulls / stretching of the fabric.
 
What is a kairo? A kairo is essentially a small heating patch or packet. Kairo essentially come in two main forms: haru (貼る (adhesive type)) and haranai (貼らない (non-adhesive, pocket type)). Both are pretty effective, but for some reason I find the pocket type to be significantly warmer than the adhesive kairo.
 
**How much do they cost?**
I bought a 10 pack of mini kairo from my local convenience store for 280円 the larger kairo 10-pack costs only 360. Not looking to buy a pack? Well the individual kairo are even cheaper, they cost somewhere between 25 and 75 yen depending on the size.
 
With temperatures in Japan dipping toward 0 degrees Celsius in Tokyo all those minutes I spend out on train platforms really start to get me down. Coming from a country with central heating and remote control starters for cars, I am more used to spending as little time as possible exposed to the elements during the cold winter months.
 
When I looked into how locals beat the chill I discovered quite a few techniques to keep warm. I found a lot of interesting solutions including the use of disposable カイロ (kairo), small packets containing powder that heats up as a catalytic reaction when exposed to oxygen. These packets are small, cheap and disposable. Still I found them kind of dull. After all, this is Japan, land of overengineered solutions to mundane problems! Enter Sanyo Eneloop to save the day. The Eneleoop Kairo Rechargable Hand Warmer is more my speed.
 
Available in two designs and a variety of colors, the Eneloop Kairo uses rechargeable batteries to heat up a small handwarmer about the size of a pack of cigarettes. Fully charged, the warmers reach around 40 Degrees Celcius and will operate for around two hours. Of course the 3,000 yen price on these babies does bring the chill back into my spine. Still, I love Eneloop stuff and I have to think that using rechargeable batteries is better than filling the landfill up with weird chemicals, and two hours of heat is a lot longer than I get when I stuff cans of vending machine coffee into my pockets.
 
The whole thing seemed a little too good to be true, but if it held up to its claims, Edible Kairo could be the invention of the century. So, Ahiru Neko decided to put both the tablets and a traditional kairo through rigorous scientific tests to see which was the better warming method.
 
Ahiru Neko decided to experiment with the conventional kairo pads that can stick to your clothing. He took eight of them and applied four to his midsection and four to his back. Prior to this he took his temperature to get a baseline reading.
 
Amazing! **His body temperature had actually gone up after sitting outside with nothing but a set of kairo for 10 minutes**. This was truly a great result but not totally unexpected given the popularity of the product.
 
As he sat still and gave his break-up with Saori a second thought, disaster struck. About a minute or so in **an excruciating burning sensation filled his entire mouth and throat**. The fermented black ginger had been gradually dissolving and filling his mouth like it was a vat of acid.
 
As the hot ginger flood continued to rise inside him he began to crunch the numbers of his suffering. Sixteen tablets at 250 milligrams a piece meant he was dealing with 4,000 milligrams of pure fermented black ginger heating the inside of his mouth and throat that would have to slowly pass through.
 
The staple way in Japan to survive the winter are kairo heat packs, typically used in pockets or socks. Kiribai took these standard items and created a special version that also fights the build-up of unpleasant odors. The **Kiribai Anti-Odor Feet Warmer Kairo Pad** can be placed inside your shoes. The five pairs of pads last eight hours and maintain an average temperature of 33C (91F).
 
The region of Tohoku is known for its harsh winters, rich traditions, abundant natural scenery, and hot springs. For hot spring lovers, a visit to northern Miyagi's Naruko is a must. The city is known as an onsen machi or hot spring town. It has a huge variety of hot springs and it seems each one is famous for its own reason-- whether that be its history, founder, extreme temperature, smell, or chemical composition. While most onsen involve stripping down and rinsing yourself before going in for a full body soak, I have also come across the ashi no yu foot bath. This is usually just a pool where several people gather and soak their feet and lower legs. Often the feet are not rinsed off before put into the pool. You can see two of these pools at JR Naruko-Onsen Station and use them free of charge. Just one block away from the station however was a first for me and my Japanese traveling companion: a hot spring for your hands.
 
Now a hot spring hand bath may not sound very impressive. And in reality it isn't. Whether hot mineral water
