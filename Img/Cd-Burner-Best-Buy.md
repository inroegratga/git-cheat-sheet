After a significant investment of time into research, patience in saving and planning, I purchased my Lang, AKA Black Betty, and I have not been disappointed. If you have questions please post them in the comments section below so that others can benefit from your question and the answers given.
 
I purchased Black Betty (the name my smoker finally earned) in the spring of 2018. Phil, a good friend of mine, and I drove from Michigan to Lang Headquarters in Nahunta GA to pick her up. While there we took advantage of a training class Lang offered with BBQ Hall of Fame, Baron of BBQ Paul Kirk. During the class we learned fire management, rub/seasoning creation, sauce creation/usage, meat preparation and cooking (we prepared and smoked a variety of meats...and took lots of leftovers home!), and smoker cleaning and maintenance.

After spending a year researching the style of smoker I wanted and another year researching (and saving for) the particular brand I felt was the best, I chose a Lang. One very helpful thing I did was stalk the Lang Smoker Owner Facebook page and ask questions of the owners there. The comments and responses on Lang vs. any other brand made my decision easy.
 
In choosing which model and size (they range from 36" patio to 108" commercial style) I was leaning toward the 36" Patio Deluxe. This was based on being practical, as well as the cost savings over a 48" of the same model. After having lots of owners tell me "Get a size bigger than you think you want" I thought through how I would use it, how much product would fit in each in terms of smoked meats, and budget. I felt comfortable moving up to the Lang 48" Deluxe Patio Smoker and pulled the trigger. I now echo many owners...when ordering, **get a size bigger than you think you want**.
 
I vacillated on whether to get the warmer box or not, as well as whether to get it with a trailer hitch or have it on wheels. I chose "wheels" and upgraded to the wagon wheel option as I have to roll Black Betty in and out of my back yard and steel casters would never have worked. I sometimes wonder if a hitch would have been better, but to this point it has not made a difference. If I end up catering more, I will most likely get a hitch...on a larger unit?.
 
The top handle (left picture) opens a butterfly from the smoker chamber to the warmer box. Baffles at the top of the warmer box allow for controlled airflow. The bottom handle opens a butterfly that goes from the top of the firebox directly into the warmer box. Using one or both of the butterfly valves along with the baffles at the top of the warmer box allow for controlled airflow and temperature. Also, allows for a choice of direct heat from the firebox or more smokey-moist air from the smoking chamber.
 
Stainless steel cleans easier than the steel racks that come with the units. Even after many cooks on Black Betty it is so easy to clean them and the oils and fats and gunk come off easily. I use a heavy-duty bristle brush to "scrub" the grates and a small rectangular trowel to scrape the gunk from the baffle plate. I also ramp the heat up after I'm done smoking and spray off the grates and baffle with my nozzle on mist setting.
 
This is a more personal choice, based on your usage. I've used it for smoking kielbasa and chicken when my smoker is full. I've used it for veggies and kraut and beans, as a cooker, and a keep-warm box. I've heard of cold climate people who use it for warming their splits and some who have removed the shelves (they are removable) and made stainless rods to hang sausage from. The extra space is really nice and if you can afford, I recommend.

The wagon wheel option is very helpful if you need to move your smoker on a regular basis. Black Betty weighs almost 900 pounds and moving her is not easy, even with wagon wheels. I have a 5x10 garden trailer with a ramp and a winch I installed. I don't know that I could get it up there with the stock pneumatic tires on the one side and steel casters on the other.
 
Like with anything, you get what you pay for. Once you figure out what kind of smoker you want to use, you'll need to figure out your budget. Once you have style of smoker and budget, search for the best quality build and best features for a unit within those constraints. Once I decided on a stick burner I researched all the stick burners I could find.
 
My budget went higher than expected, but I would not change a thing! I believe Black Betty was around $3,400. Don't forget you'll need to pick it up or get it shipped which is an additional cost. Lang does not wholesale, so all units are manufactured in and shipped from Nahunta GA.
 
If you do some research you'll find there are a lot of well known BBQ joints that use Lang. One of them is Southern Soul in St. Simon's Island about 30 miles from Nahunta. If you drive to pick up a Lang smoker, you MUST go there. They use a couple of Langs and they are one of the best BBQ joints I've been to!
 
I started learning on a $200 Char Griller that I adapted to make a smoker. It had 4 cast iron grill surface sections. I would remove one section and put my charcoal fire on that side and add wood chunks as needed/desired. It worked great and I learned a lot. I did this for a few years. I also owned an electric smoker (only for a short time, then Craig-listed it) and a PBC (Pit Barrel Cooker) which used for a little longer time, then Craig-listed.
 
Smoking does not require an expensive piece of equipment. But, and this is a big but, my quality of end product, consistency of process and enjoyment have all gone up significantly with Black Betty. And I won't have to replace her...she'll outlive me!!
 
Thanks for the fine detail. I am in the market for one of these and was having a hard time of what custom items I would need. You answered all the questions. One question I have is did you look at Shirley Fabrication at all before buying the Lang? I am down to Shirley and Lang at the moment.
 
Thank you for putting this information out there. I am finalizing my order for the 48 deluxe wagon wheel. I do have one question. The butterfly for the warmer. Is this an option that must be requested? How would you control the heat in the warmer box without it?
 
"This has been the paradigm for cooktops in the U.S.," Kenmore Brand Product Manager Anthony Lam said. "We purposely put the best burner in the front right because customers are used to having it in that location."
 
Your best bet is probably the Trig Assault Frigate, but you definitely need different fits for different missions.
Or just get the garmur fit (or any other fit for the team burners), and then you can use this single fit for the 4 team burners (or at least 3, because of the strong shield and long range of that Jaguar)!
 
Moreover, I think that getting good at multiboxing helped me to become a better pilot. For example, learning hotkeys and getting good at keeping track of multiple things at once helped me to not only get better at multiboxing, but also at single boxing.
 
Can somebody try a Draugur please? If that thing can tank good enough with 2 low slots, it will probably be the best thing for this mission. It can fly at 3429m/s and deal 717 dps at most without overheating. It can even moon walk 100km at least twice in the mission (not sure whether this will get you CONCORDed though).
 
The Cuisinart Countertop Single Burner has enough power for everyday cooking needs at a reasonable price and is our No. 1 pick. If you're looking for a bare-bones-but-capable burner at a bargain-basement price, we recommend the IMUSA GAU-80305 Electric Single Burner.
 
Sara, I'm so glad you posted this because my Whirly Popper has, unfortunately, become severely disabled and I don't really want to shell out another $30 for a new one. The hubs and I did the same thing when we were poor, childless students.
 
I'm a big fan, but I think this is my first comment. I have made this exact recipe for some time and after burning a batch of two I learned a handy trick. After adding the corn and sugar to the oil, I take the pan off the burner for 30 seconds. Not sure why it works, but it always turns out perfectly.
 
Do I remember what life was like before becoming a parent? Of course I do and I miss those days much like I miss making 'real' popcorn. That's now the domain of the microwave -only because I dread the cleanup of the popcorn popper. I ask you who is the idiot that designs these electrical appliances without removable parts that can be washed easily.
 
I love our whirly pop!!! My mom loves the kettle corn so much that it is the one thing she requests when she comes to visit. We will have to try heating the oil first. Oh and I like to add a little vanilla occasionally.

I use kosher salt almost exclusively, with the exception of baking things like cakes and cookies. Kate and I have been meaning to do an entire post on salts because we get a lot of questions about that. Sea salt can be a good substitution when recipes call for kosher salt, but kosher salt is still best.
 
Last year my wife and I visited, and survived nicely without mobile service while we were there. I had already loaded my mobile with a mapping app for Stockholm that used my GPS to let me know where I was, and that was sufficient for our needs.
 
prepaid-data-sim-card dot wikia dot com slash wiki slash Sweden lists several Swedish vendors of mobile services, and it looks like Halebop has plans that would work for us (not a lot of data, not a lot of money, voice calls included).
 
Does anyone have any experience acquiring a "burner" phone in Sweden and activating it like this? I know that my U.S. phone (Republic Wireless, which primarily uses the
