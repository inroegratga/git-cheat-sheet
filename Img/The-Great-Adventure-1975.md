Only watched the show when he had on a famous athlete or musician. I vaguely recall watching the GA episodes. Do remember him doing an interview in the arena and riding the Giant Wheel. I'm with you...love to see the videos from his tapings at GA.

**Here is a picture of Mike Douglas in the Safari Park during the taping of his show. For any web search experts out there, we are still looking for leads in obtaining copies of the week long show taped at Great Adventure in 1975.**
 
Here's another great photo from the Mike Douglas Show at Great Adventure in 1975. We are still trying to hunt down recordings of the week long show at the park just in case anyone runs across the videos.
 
I'm just seeing this post about still not finding where to get these tapes and I'd swear that I sent you a message last year that I had found the company that has the distribution rights to the Mike Douglas Show. Clearly I didn't post anything here on GAH, but again, I know I found the information including address and phone number because I remember thinking OMG, this stuff has been sitting right under our nose. The company is located in West Long Branch. Could I have possibly sent you a personal email? I'll go back through my sent mail folders, but I definitely located the company because I almost fell off the chair when I noticed the West Long Branch address.
 
Okay, this is NOT the information I believed I had sent you with the West Long Branch address, however, there is a phone number, contact person, and some ordering information on how to go about obtaining specific episodes...
 
It was 1975, and I was part of the Great Canadian Wagon Train Adventure leaving Kleinburg, Ont., to finish in Peace River, Alta. The concept: take 13 wagons, 42 horses and 50+ people, leave the city behind and travel by teams and covered wagons like our forefathers.
 
We had more misadventures than grand ones. We had runaways, crashes, injuries, tornadoes, loss of members, long lonely stretches and the constant drive to complete the trek. We were told we would never make it, and that made us more determined to prove them wrong.
 
All persons along the way of our journey treated us with nothing but kindness. That was a treasure beyond words. We were strangers yet they made us feel welcome even a part of them by the time we finished.
 
Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" is a sensationally effective action picture, a scary thriller that works all the better because it's populated with characters that have been developed into human beings we get to know and care about. It's a film that's as frightening as "The Exorcist," and yet it's a nicer kind of fright, somehow more fun because we're being scared by an outdoor-adventure saga instead of by a brimstone-and-vomit devil.

 
The story, as I guess everyone knows by now, involves a series of attacks on swimmers by a great white shark, the response of the threatened resort island to its loss of tourist business, and, finally, the epic attempt by three men to track the shark and kill it. There are no doubt supposed to be all sorts of levels of meanings in such an archetypal story, but Spielberg wisely decides not to underline any of them. This is an action film content to stay entirely within the perimeters of its story, and none of the characters has to wade through speeches expounding on the significance of it all. Spielberg is very good, though, at presenting those characters in a way that makes them individuals.
 
Before the three men get on that leaky old boat and go forth to do battle with what amounts to an elemental natural force, we know them well enough to be genuinely interested in the ways they'll respond. There's Brody (Roy Scheider), the police chief, who came to the island from New York looking, so he thought, for a change from the fears of the city. There's Quint (Robert Shaw), a caricature of the crusty old seafaring salt, who has a very particular personal reason for hating sharks. And there's Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), the rich kid turned oceanographer, who knows best of all what a shark can do to a man, and yet is willing to get into the water with one.
 
All three performances are really fine. Scheider is the character most of us identify with. He's actually scared of the water, doesn't like to swim and, when he sees the giant shark swim past the boat for the first time, we believe him when he informs Quint, very sincerely, "We need a bigger boat." Shaw brings a degree of cheerful exaggeration to his role as Quint, stomping around like a cross between Captain Queeg and Captain Hook, and then delivering a compelling five-minute monologue about the time the Indianapolis went down and he was one of more than a thousand men in the water. By the time rescue came, two-thirds of them had been killed by sharks.
 
Probably the most inspired piece of casting in the movie is the use of Richard Dreyfuss as the oceanographer. He made this film soon after playing the driven, scheming, overwhelmingly ambitious title character in "The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz," and the nice kid, college-bound, in "American Graffiti." Here he looks properly young, engaging, and scholarly, and introduces the technical material about sharks in a way that reinforces our elemental fear of them.
 
Which brings us to the shark itself. Some of the footage in the film is of an actual great white shark. The rest uses a mechanical shark patterned on the real thing. The illusion is complete. We see the shark close up, we look in its relentless eye, and it just plain feels like a shark. "Jaws" is a great adventure movie of the kind we don't get very often any more. It's clean-cut adventure, without the gratuitous violence of so many action pictures. It has the necessary amount of blood and guts to work -- but none extra. And it's one hell of a good story, brilliantly told.
 

Visiting Siem Reap, Cambodia means visiting Angkor Wat. This temple complex was dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu in the 12th century CE by the Khmer King Suryavarman II. It is among the largest religious buildings ever created. Today it is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

 
Our guide and the driver arrived to pick us up at 4:30 am to begin our day long tour through the 420 acre Angkor Wat temple complex as well as the ancient city of Angkor Thom. Our guide led us through the dark from the Angkor Wat parking area to a field facing that temple. A hush fell over the crowd of visitors from all over the world as we witnessed the sun rising behind the five towers.
 
In 1975 a communist regime known as the Khmer Rouge conquered the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh. From 1975 to 1979 the Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, set in motion a campaign of genocide that claimed the lives of up to two million people. One in four Cambodians were killed during this period.
 
Connie is correct. Our guide was so open and vulnerable and at times we had the biggest lump in our throats trying to understand what he had been through. He was just a little older than us. Imagining the difference of his childhood and my childhood was humbling and hard to imagine. The US just stood by as this was happening. And yet, the man has a beautiful family with grandchildren and he had just won a new IPHONE!
 
We did run into a band of monkeys near one temple. Our guide had warned us to not have food in our pockets. We witnessed small children getting assaulted by monkeys to get their bags of candy. It was kind of funny, kind of alarming. We walked past a line of scooters and one monkey opened up the compartment on the scooter, grabbed a bottled water and started guzzling.

 
We flew into Phuket and drove about an hour and half to our destination, Kata Beach. The taxi driver let Jeff connect his playlist which we cranked. He has awesome eclectic taste in music. Once checked in, we tried to find the beach. Due to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, there was a massive wall most likely built to save lives in the event of another. My bff, Melissa, lost her dear friend Carol in that tsunami and I remember it well.
 
The place reminded us of Myrtle Beach. Very crowded, very hot and humid, full of cheap tourist items for sale. Every tourist was wearing the same white hooded shirt with the same elephant pants. It
