The **Nokia 5510** is a mobile phone announced on October 11, 2001[1] and released in December of that year. The Nokia 5510 features a full QWERTY keyboard, an 84 x 48 monochrome display, and is notable for its digital music player, the company's first mobile phone with music player capabilities.[2] It has a 64 MB memory for storing audio files. It's taco shaped phone like its successor Nokia 3300.
 
Compared to other mobile phones of its generation, the 5510 is unusual in that it has an almost complete QWERTY keyboard, rather than the conventional telephone keypad. This keyboard is divided on the left and right sides of the front panel, with the 84 x 48 monochrome display at the center, and the navigational buttons below it (the display and navigational buttons are almost identical to those found on the 3310). Also, four black buttons are located on the side of the phone to allow quick access to the music player, FM radio, and the volume controls.
 
The removable backplate on the handset was designed in such a way that pressure on the middle of the plastic could easily cause the plate to crack; this was highlighted in many reviews of the model at the time of release.
 
The 5510 could play both MP3 and AAC audio files but not in their usual formats, instead the files must be encrypted and packaged into a Lockstream Embedded (.lse) files, which was a DRM technology that ensured that the encrypted files could only be played on the device. This encryption could be achieved using the bundled Nokia PC Suite software. Additionally it could record AAC audio directly from its internal FM radio, or through its built-in 2.5 mm (3/32") audio jack to another format with the extension .rel which only the phone could play back. The music player on the phone also has a built-in equalizer with several pre-sets to fine-tune the music being played.
 
The bundled version of the Nokia Audio Manager software was designed to encode music and transfer it to the phone via USB, but encoding would typically take several minutes per song and the software only ran under Windows. The design was that files encoded and transferred to the device could not be converted back to their original formats for playing on other devices.

However alternatives to the Nokia Audio Manager did exist, such as Nokryptia,[3] a cross-platform command line tool distributed as source code which by exploiting a special case of the Lockstream Embedded file format could convert MP3 audio files almost instantly to the 5510 playable Lockstream Embedded format. Nokryptia worked by prefixing the MP3 file with a special header that then allowed the MP3 to follow unencrypted (the tool also supported the reverse, removing the header to restore the original MP3 file, however this was only possible on files encoded by the technique and the tool could not restore a file encoded by the Nokia Audio Manager).
 
I had tried to switch to a feature phone a few years earlier, but that phone was a really dumb Samsung from 2010 or so with no 4G, Wi-Fi or a modern messaging app. That attempt failed, but could things be different with a more modern phone like Nokia 2720 Flip?
 
While going completely old-school with, for example, Nokia 8800 from 2005 would undoubtedly be uber nerdy and cool, the 2720 Flip is actually a modern device that has some crucial features that older phones lack. Number one is 4G support. With operators around the world shutting down 2G and 3G bands, an old Nokia phone would soon become useless in most countries.
 
Then there is Google Assistant, which actually works OK for entering text with your voice. The problem is, I switch between four languages in my daily life, and of those, Google Assistant only supports English.
 
Navigating your contacts is a different story. I have several hundred contacts imported from Google, and it takes the Nokia several seconds to open my contact list. After that, searching for a contact is reasonably fast, which, I hear, is a big improvement compared to the state of things a year or so ago.
 
KaiOS has a built-in music player that can play tracks from the phone memory or the SD card. It automatically groups the tracks by albums or artists based on the ID3 tags and is generally convenient to use. When using Bluetooth headphones, you can control playback with the headphone buttons. The playback continues when you close the phone, too.
 
In the end, I opted in for using the wonderful gPodder app on my desktop computer for downloading podcast episodes and syncing them to the phone as regular audio files. I then use the stock music player for listening.
 
I still have to rely on my iPhone and iPad for some tasks, but those cases are generally few and far between. One notable case is turn-by-turn navigation with Google Maps, Waze or Maps.me, as well as occasional usage of my banking apps. This is when I appreciate the ability to turn on a Wi-Fi hotspot on my Nokia. Most of the time, though, my iPhone is off and sitting in my table drawer.
 
Who remembers punching in key-combinations found online into their Nokia 3210 to create custom ringtones?I spent more time than I would to admit doing this in my youth.Over the weekend I decided as a bit of an nostalgic exercise to see if I could implement a Nokia Composer clone using JavaScript and the Web Audio API.From here, I expanded on the player to provide the ability to download the generated ringtone as a WAV file.
 
I decided to leverage in-line React and Babel, so as to keep all the logic on a single webpage.This makes for a more succient demo, and provides the ability to automatically highlight the required code in-line.
 
Looking at the above code you can see the described sections are broken apart, with the default values and melody notes subsquently being parsed individually.The default values are parsed first, so as to have these available when parsing the melody section.Using the supplied specification I was able to ensure that only valid melody notes were parsed.I found using regular expression named capture groups provided a very elegant means to produce the defined values per note (providing defaults were there were omissions).
 
With the RTTTL now parsed, my next objective was to translate the defined note/octaves of the melody into frequencies of which I could send to the Oscillator.This lead me to research into the the Twelve-Tone Equal Temperament system of tuning.Using this system and alittle bit of Math, we are able to calculate the frequency of a given note/octave using a known base note frequency.Typically A4 (aka Stuttgart pitch, 440Hz) is used as the base frequency of which all calculations are done, however, I noticed that if I instead use C4 (Middle-C, 261.63Hz) it would save some offset Math calculations being required.
 
This forumla can again be implemented in JavaScript to calculate the note one lower and one higher than the provided frequency (in this case C4):Notice that using C as the base note allows omission of any offset calculation needing to be applied, thanks to the the array being zero-indexed.
 
Using the parsed RTTTL and Web Audio API AudioContext/Oscillator, I am able to cycle through the melody ensuring that the given frequency is set for the desired duration within the Oscillator.This completed the implementation required to play the composition within the Browser ?.
 
The final step to this demostration was adding the ability to generate a WAV file from the supplied RTTTL composition.Thanks to the OfflineAudioContext, I was able to employ the same logic described above to generate an in-memory AudioBuffer representation of the melody.
 
To conclude, I enjoyed exploring how Nokia ringtones were represented in RTTTL, and how you could use alittle bit of Music Theory/Math to generate the corresponding frequencies.The Web Audio API AudioContext/Oscillator abstracted away alot of intricacies required to produce the desired sounds.This allowed me to play the sound in real-time, as well was produce an in-memory representation that I could generate a WAV file from.I found the most interesting part of the exercise was researching into how a WAV files was constructed, from a raw bits/bytes level.
 
Adafruit has written a nice Arduino library and tutorial for using this display. It was perfect for my needs, as their library can easily draw text, lines, rectangles, circles and other shapes to the display.
 
First of all, I came up with a format for saving my data. The encoded data file would consist of ASCII characters. If the ASCII character was from 0x00 to 0x3F in hex (the first 6 bits, or from B000000 to B111111) then it would be treated as data.If I wanted the first 6 pixels of the first row on the frame buffer to appear in this binary pattern: 101010 then I would set the character to be 0x2A (B101010), and increases the X coordinate by 6. If I repeat this character, it would set the next 6 pixels to 101010, and so on. This is what is used to set the image of the display.When this is done 14 times, I end up with 84 pixels which is exactly the width of one of the rows of the display. Perfect fit!
 
Writing the Arduino video player program was the most difficult part. I used the SD library included with Arduino to read the files of the SD card and wrote up a file chooser what uses the buttons on the shield, and a routine to read data from the chosen file off the SD card, draw the images and handle the commands.Everything worked out OK in the end after a day of work, and I had a working product. However, I still needed to finish my goal o
