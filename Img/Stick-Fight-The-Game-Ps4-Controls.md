Stick Fight: The Game is a physics-based fighting game that allows you to play as a stick figure that must fight other player controlled characters to the death using a variety of weapons while trying to avoid getting killed by the environment around you.
 
The player can use both WASD as well as arrow keys to move. To aim, shoot, or punch, the player must press the LMB (left mouse button), press the RMB to block, and if you're holding a weapon, press F or B to throw your weapon.
 
These levels are one of the most complex types, as they host a variety of game-changing features. They are commonly found to have lava-floors, which slowly sink, as well as various chains and other destructible objects.
 
I find the latter configuration much more natural/ergonomical. Especially since the concept of HOTAS (Hands On Throttle-And-Stick) implies that the pilot has his hands on the same control element most of the time.
 
I've heard of one reasone for having a center stick is to allow for ambidextrous operation (operations with both hands, alternatively).But this seems to be counter-intuitive with HOTAS, especially since the throttle controls are still on the left side only.

Side sticks do have the advantage of less cockpit clutter. The stick is mounted off to the right and doesn't directly block critical instruments from the pilot's view or have its range of motion restricted by flight gear, kneeboards, etc.
 
As far as size and weight are concerned, both center mounted and side sticks are pretty much the same in a fly-by-wire aircraft - just a 4-way transducer LRU with a handgrip attached to it. In a/c with conventional control systems the center stick was a necessity as it acted as a lever arm allowing the pilot to overcome aerodynamic forces on the control surfaces with muscle power alone and one could force a maneuver using both hands. In the age of hydraulic flight controls and fly-by-wire, this is irrelevant.
 
As to ergonomics, it's fairly comfortable to fly a center stick as your wrists will naturally rest on your thighs when seated and your hands naturally float to that position. Side sticks are also comfortable but require an armrest to operate effectively, particularly when pulling Gs.
 
Besides the issues already covered, it appears to me that older fighters would prefer a center stick so the pilot can **switch hands if he needs to see behind** the cockpit in either direction.
 
The newer USA F22 & F35 use a helmet with virtual vision and supposedly the pilots don't need to twist their heads to see behind them - though some pilots have challenged the safety and effectiveness of this feature.
 
This is a side stick F16. Note the ability of the pilot to brace with his free hand looking to his right but unable to do the same looking left because his right hand must stay on the side stick. A center stick would have allowed a free hand in either direction.

Well I assumed the controller mapping feature was "sysyem wide", not a Nintendo-specific thing. I know Xbox One lets you use remapping on all controller brands as an OS feature, but has 2 problems I can see.
 
Second i tried using a Hori Pad and THAT was unremapplable. Nintendo says they are looking for licensing, when in reality they are locking out either Wired USB controllers or ones without Amiibo readers.
 
I try emailing them. Their email answered a tangential question and wasn't really reading every word in the letter, and gave a general comment about getting its stuff working, but didn't address the remap issue.
 
Not Flight stick then. But then again if it's not a Nintendo Device one still has to contact manufacture but if the games itself doesn't support the Fight Stick then nothing can be done about it. This goes to the Game developer to make the support for the Fight Stick not Nintendo. If the manufacture doesn't want to update then get your refund and find another can will work with using the Fight Stick.
 
Yes but who makes a right-handed fight stick? The only time a right-handed fight stick ever appeared on a Nintendo system was before it became known as a fight stick and was known as an arcade stick. It was made by Beeshu, and they were denied licensing supposedly because they offered right-handed controllers. The only controller that was licensed that fits that description was the nes Beeshu Super stick, and the two reasons why they allowed that was because there was also a Turbo Grafx and Genesis version of a similar stick, and what later be bankrupted bishu was the fact that they were using mirrored buttons cause the price difference to go up by the time Street Fighter 2 came out, doubling the buttons of the Genesis controller therefore doubling the difference in price.
 
I heard that warranties cannot be denied if unlicensed products are used through the USB because Nintendo doesn't wholly own the USB standard therefore it doesn't control the licensing to make it USB compatible.
 
@tripletopper It seems that only 1st party controllers are compatible with the remap function on Switch. My 8bitdo controller does have a re-map function via software/app though, so not impossible on 3rd party devices. Worth reaching out to Brook to see if they have something similar.
 
A bit drastic maybe, but I guess as a last resort you could always just rewire the buttons to get them where you want them. Not exactly practical if you're going to be constantly remapping, but if you use the same button layout for a few games, or only use the stick for a particular game then would be worth it IMO.
 
8bitdo GameCube/Wii adapter (no usb on it)
Mayflash S Pro
The original Retrobit USB Saturn/Mega Drive controllers (that weren't compatible with Switch so I used the Mayflash pro to connect them)
Bluetooth Retrobit Saturn/MD controllers which don't require an adapter and I believe are remappable.
 
The only suggestions I have is to try and use it without the Brook adapter. The Switch works with way more controllers than people realise. If the Stick itself has a switch that changes from X Input to D input or any other options then try that with or without the adapter.
 
You may have some luck with the Mayflash S Pro adapter but I don't have the same stick as you so I can't test it and in good conscience recommend you laying out any money for it. Not sure if it would require an update anyway (PC only, i nearly broke mine trying to update it with Mac)
 
@ralphdibny Unless I'm reading the OP wrong the Brook Universal USB Interface isn't an adaptor, but rather the PCB used in the custom controller. Might work with a 3rd party adaptor like the Mayflash you mentioned, but couldn't recommend it without knowing for sure it worked.
 
I've never actually tried to remap my 8bitdo using the Switch software - good to know it's possible if I ever need to do it. I've actually got a Hori mini fight stick too that I'll have to try, but given there isn't a Hori controller in the compatibility list, I doubt it'll work.
 
USB Mega Drive controller that came with the Mega Drive Mini - works with S Pro adapter and buttons are remappable (appears as Pro controller) (this must have been the mega drive pad I remembered remapping!)
 
At the very least, my tests show that everything I've connected via the S Pro adapter can have the buttons remapped. Whether that's true of all devices, I don't know as my as my sample size is limited.
 
I've have tried a similat PS2ayflash remapper. It only seemed to remap sone of the buttons. For example, you couldn't invert the stick for righty play. I know, I tried it on my Street Fighter 15th Anniversary stick. Luckily, my sinister stick has a left stick plug and a right stick plug. So all I need are buttons.
 
Well first I'm going to try the free solution of updating my Brooke Universal USB fight stick pad. If that doesn't work then maybe I'll try that once you confirm that it will work with my Brook Universal USB fight stick, unless updating the brook gives me control back to my buttons.
 
This project is a fightstick created primarily for use with PC and PlayStation 3 and was made for my Rapid Prototyping course at the University Of West GA. The only guideline for the project was that it had to include a physical element and use an arduino chip.
 
When thinking about what I would want to make I realized that my current fightstick was to large and heavy to take to conventions where I may or may not want to use it. So I thought I could use an arduino to create a smaller, lightweight fightstick.
 
30mm are considered the stranded button size while 24mm are the smaller buttons commonly used as start or select buttons. You will likely want to go with the 30mm size, although I used all 24mm for my project.
 
Also make sure to pay attention to the connector size. Either .110" or .187" should work fine but you will have to buy different wires based on the connector size. For my project I used .110" exclusively.
