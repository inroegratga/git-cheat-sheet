As of 2020, there are so many resources scattered around the web that **bookmarks** are essential to remember what tool you are in. So many that my bookmarks are arranged in many folders. I have even eliminated the name in each one of them with the intention of having more space and it is really comfortable to click on the pure icon of the requested web page knowing with precision where it will take you.
 
One last thing I would like to recommend you adding is that sometimes the icons are black and can disappear on the bookmark bar. It would be great to have a tool that can change the icon color into negative or positive depending on the case and even better in an automatized way.
 
How can I change my Dropbox folder icons and use my own icons? Until recently, I could change icons to my own icon picture, which made working quicker. I use Mac OS Mojave on a MacBook Pro, and use Dropbox from my Mac OS desktop finder window. As of the second week of October, all my icons reverted to generic folder icons and I am not able to change them. Is there a new method, or is there a new Dropbox download that I need? How can I again change my folder icons? (10/24/19)

Hi,@TedC I'm having the same problem, so I tried your suggestion and installed the software update/ beta version. All my custom icons are still missing... which is a pretty huge pain in the butt because we're talking about hundreds of files that I spent a lot of time organizing with custom icons. Any other ideas of something I could try? Also, suddenly this dialogue box has come up on my last couple of re-starts: Dropbox needs to change permissions for the FolderL/Users/[myname]/Dropbox??? I enter the password as prompted, but just not sure why it's suddenly happening and if it has anything to do with my icon issue.
 
Hey @TedC I'm having a similar issue with my business dropbox account regarding being able to change the folder icons. I can change them on my personal account. I'm the Admin of my business account so I'm not sure why I can't. Can you please help? Thank you!
 
Hey, have two questions. I'm writing an instrument driver for an instrument I have here at work, and I have the VI's working. I have the VIs organized and inserted into a library, which is in a project including that library and an examples folder (so basically the way Labview downloaded instrument drivers are set up). I put all this in the instr.lib folder, and the VIs show up in the functions palette just fine. So, based on that setup, my questions are:
 
I think the secret is in having an mnu file, which defines what will appear in the palettes. You can create one by editing the palettes (under Tools>>Advanced) and there you should be able to remove items and to edit the palette icon by right clicking it. You should probably also make sure that the mnu file is saved in the same folder, so that you can have it in other PCs. Note that the palette editor has this annoying confirmation dialog which tends to hide under other windows and which you need to get to finish editing, so move it to somewhere you can find it before you start editing.
 
I recommend just using VIPM to manage your driver and distribute it. It has a custom palette editor (that is better than the built-in LabVIEW one). Building a package with VIPM is simple and it is even easier to install. And you can do all of this with the free version of VIPM.
 
I'm running Xfce 4.10 on Debian Jessie. I have my desktop set up pretty much the way I want it. One thing I cant figure out, is how to change the icon image for say a desktop directory or document from the default icon. I'm not talking about changing an icon set to make it look better, I want to right click the icon, select an image of my liking and use that as in Mate. I can do this with any icon in the Xfce panels, but not on the desktop.
 
Wouldn't it be fairly simple, and not break current behavior, if Thunar and the XFCE Desktop simply looked for a file in folders called .xfce-custom-folder-icon that contained the name of the icon you want displayed for that folder?
 
This would travel with portable devices like usb sticks or dvd-ram, etc. and would just be ignored by OS's / distros that didn't use it or know what to do with it. If the icon is missing, just use the default.
 
xfdesktop does support custom folders as of version 4.11.0. Simply put a jpg file in the same folder with the name either folder.jpg, cover.jpg, albumart.jpg, or fanart.jpg and it will become the folder icon on the desktop (commit).
 
After reading a lot and trying for 2 days in a row, I managed to make something work by following this Microsoft tutorial on folder icons, but it's not perfect - changes don't take place immediately. I need to restart explorer / reboot my computer or wait a couple of minutes (randomly) until I see the old icon change to the new icon.
 
**Problem:** After chaining my .ico file, I expect to see the result immideiately, but I only see it after 30 seconds to 4 minutes or so. It changes instantly as well sometimes, but very rarely, and I want it to work 100% of the time.
 
I found a way to see the icon change immediately, but it worked only when manually renaming desktop.ini through the explorer itself. (changing desktop.ini to uppercase/lowercase or to desktop-temp.ini and then back to desktop.ini) When doing so, I see the folder icon change immediately.
 
That led me to a hope that I can do the same programmatically, so I tried this C++ code, that changes desktop.ini to desktop-temp.ini and back to desktop.ini, also with notifying windows that a change has occurred, but it did not work unfortunately.
 
I use to personalize the appearance of my Mac by changing icons of folders - this works fine in Monterey, too, with the exception of the Documents folder. I just cannot change that folder icon by pasting it in cmd-I, like for all other folders. Most probably, this is a permissions issue, but I cannot find information about this. Can anyone please point me to a solution? I have seen that someone else had asked the same question for Big Sur, but never received an answer, unfortunately.
 
thanks @SFugenzi!! i've been searching for a way to change the documents folder icon for quite some time now. i'm usually not very eager to turn off macOS security components. but since you successfully changed the icon, and the OP also had success using your method, i figured i would give it a try. it worked like a charm! thanks again!
 
Glad to hear you guys are as happy as I am - I'd really appreciate, if ï£¿ fixed this issue (which I would call a **bug**), since there is absolutely no reason (security issue or whatever) to prevent the user from customizing his personal folder according to his likes. :-7
 
I want set icon to my folder in My external hard drive but when I change it (by right click on it and -> properties -> customize -> change icon (i address the icon from my extenal hard drive)) it just change in my windows and when plug my extenarnal-hard to another windows it's don't show my icon! how should fix this?
 
Now this will work for Windows, and i suspect it'll need a certain degree of maintenance for this kind of OCD folder vanity (desktop.inis get overwritten by easily, unless you mark as Read-Only for all these desktop.inis and .ico files)
 
As to your "P.S: is there a way to set icon for folder show in all os (linux, windows, OSX, ..)" question - yes, there is a way, but it involves several multiple steps that is simply too long to be answered here.
 
Second there is a folder.icon file in the .../places/48 (default nautilus zoom is 48) that for some reason might index and cache the file for shorter loading times which I removed until I restarted nautilus to see changes applied to size 48.
 
Nautilus uses the appropriate icon size for the appropriate display size (zoom) of folders in nautilus seemingly to save loading times. So if you only change .../scalable/folder.svg it will only apply to the "unused" big and tiny sizes. You will need to see which sizes are still the old icon and replace these too.
