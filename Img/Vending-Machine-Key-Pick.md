First you need to choose a ballpoint pen. Its exterior diameter needs to be the same or slightly smaller than the opening of the lock. Then remove the ink tube. Because you need to use the exterior of the ballpoint pen to open the lock.

If you are a vending machine owner, you may be worried. Because the tools to pick the lock are so readily available, there is a good chance that the vending machine can be picked up by someone else. **Is there a lock to avoid being picked?**
 
Of course, it is ideal not to be stolen. Vanma smart lock has a flexible authorization function. the manager can authorize unlocking time and date. Only within the authorized time, employees can unlock the lock. When the authorized time is exceeded, the key cannot open the Vanma smart lock.

Don't really have any high risk locations - picked up a apartment location a few years back with two bev machines and I think a tenant there had a key to the machines and was taking money, but he/she was smart and only took about 10-15% of the cash so it took me a while to catch on (and I was lazy about swapping out the locks) - swapped out the locks and problem went away.
 
Have some places that kids can access the machines and they like to stick crap in the validators/coin mechs - leaves, pieces of paper and pennies...craploads of pennies everytime I get a location where kids have access, pennies start showing up.

Anyway, have a decent hotel account with a bottle drop and snack machine in the lobby - nice location probably a 2-1/2 or 3 star hotel - they keep it pretty nice, have after-hours security and cameras.
 
On Sat went for regular service and walk in to see OUT OF ORDER signs on both machines - WTF? They looked fine from the outside, opened them up and son-of-a-biscuit....cassettes gone from both coin mechs, change buckets gone from both machines and validators cleaned out - rotten bastages.
 
Locks were not drilled, no damage to the machines - figure some tweaker got hands on one of those tubular lock pick sets off ebay or something and just opened them up - have registered locks so supposedly no one else has the key and I can account for every one that I've ever received so locks must have been picked.
 
Replaced the cassettes and change buckets, got both machines up and running - my contact there checked the video feed - saw his security guard escort some guy with a tool box into the vending area and then walk back out without him - suspect the guy showed up and announced he was there to "work" on the vending machines and got escorted straight to the machines to rip them off - ballsy.
 
The account has no interest in "solving the crime" - they don't want criminal activity on their property and if the machines are attracting lowlifes desperate to get at the $$ they will want the machines removed/replaced with machines less susceptible. So going to start with stronger locks and then move to cages if that becomes necessary.
 
lol, if he can pick a tubular, he can pick any lock, id throw a hidden cam inside show it to the police and make a report, as he can be a pro locksmith guy, who has to have a licence to use those tools, cages will not help you, unless they are inside the machine, think smart not secure, put a detterent on, the camera will do it, but must have one visible (dummy cam) and one inside, hidden, and also dont forget that it could be someone you know, or a local vendor pissed off at you for some reason, anything can be! good luck.
 
I have a hotel location the was hit a couple of times. I put a "smile you are on camera" sign on it. Which they actually are. Most hotel/motels have pretty good camera systems. Both times they caught the guys, but going to court is a huge hassle.
 
that'll work also, you're a vendor, think smart, cheap, and most effective way to keep them away, and dont forget, while youre busy scratching your head on these 2, protect the rest of your investments as well!
 
Yep - Hotel has cameras that cover entrance/exit to the area (small room) where the machines are but not actually on the machines themselves - they have footage of the guy they think did it, but only entering/leaving the room, not in the act.
 
They sell those tubular lock pick sets on Amazon for like $30 - I am going to buy one and see how easy they are to use on some of my machines in the shop - will find out pretty quick how tough it is.
 
At apartments and hotels it's a matter of when, not if, you will be broken into. You have to put high security locks on - no Ace locks. Put any factory security kits on and secure them with hockey pucks with high security lock cylinders. Use aftermarket T-handle covers and heavy side hasps with pucks. Cages are wonderful as well.
 
Also, if you run T handle covers use big beefy brand name locks. Medeco/ABLOY/American lock. None of that Masterlock bullshit. Same with the hockey pucks. If you do it right it should run you over 100 dollars per machine.
 
Same thing happened to me a couple years back. I would get a call from my accounts that my machine doors were open. They hit about 20 accounts doing exactly what you described - cassettes gone, coin box gone, and bill box gone. One of my accounts, a motel, got them on camera but it wasn't clear enough to see faces. They popped the locks and were out in less than 2 minutes. Thought I'd go the hasp route to slow them down. Everything was good for about a month and then got hit again, same accounts. They cut through the hasps and popped the locks. I finally had enough and ordered Abloy locks that deadbolt if they are tampered with. My lock guy told me that anyone that knows locks (which these guys probably do) would know that these are un-pickable. Problem solved, haven't gotten hit again since and it's been a couple of years. The only issue is that if someone does try to drill the locks it will deadbolt and no one will get into it including me. The difference is that I can spend the time to do a thorough drill job on the t handle where a thief wants to get in and out fast. Good luck to you.
 
If you have not already, do make a police report on this one... you are probably not the only victim but you have some video at least. There are people who have key collections and make the rounds, sometimes alone or sometimes as a group. Depending on where you got your registered locks they may not be as uncommon as you think. I have had amateurs use the tubular lockpicks and they usually mess up the locks in the process, so you would know if they were picked. I have had pretty good luck with Medeco locks.
 
let me get this straight, you guys are saying that a t handle lock from an no-name brand vs a medeco brand is not as easily pick-able? to my knowledge, all tubular locks are pick-able, I've lost keys before, I've picked them all, its not the lock, its more of the pick that's being used, sometimes it took me a few minutes, and sometimes it took me a lot longer, i know my locks are nothing crazy, i got them from eBay, 20 locks, with a random key, that i know im the only one that has it. most of these companies that sell you locks and keys would say that "no one within 100 mile radius of you has the same key" that's a bunch of BS, i have another vendor near me, and just for giggles i decided to put my key in it, guess what happened???? so i don't believe that BS, do you really think that they will sit there and map out every vendor and his location? they do the same thing were doing. somehow i feel a bit safer ordering from eBay, as i know they are coming from far away, i know they only have the amount i ordered keyed alike, they are definitely not keeping copies, then again they can, but even if they did, they would have to hit every machine within lets say 10 miles radius to even get close to it, which will be completely useless, and a waste of time to them. On the other hand, a network of thieves selling locks to other vendors, is not a bad idea also, the guy from eBay sends me my 20 locks and a spare key to a friend in the area, all he has to do is begin the elimination process by trying every key hes got for the area, which probably wont be too hard if there's not to many orders, but think about it. if you're ordering your keys, and they do decide to ask you what area you're running with your machines, just tell them a BS state and location, this way you're safe.
