Welcome to a game with a premise as long as the time itself. Where runic language takes the helm in Lost Lands 8, and the line between modernity and magic blurs. What do the ancients tell, what do those flashbacks mean?
 
The game takes us to a flashback, a vision of the past, telling us about the tale of the war maiden. That's when the girl's dad comes home, with a treasure chest from the lost lands that they found from the excavation.

Would you look at that? There was an hourglass within it, a shattered one at that. Once revealed, the hourglass turns the father to sand, while the granny begins to shake her amulet to reveal a hidden portal.
 
Once inside, we are greeted with a world straight from Fairy Tails. The goal here is to find a cure for Maaron (the father). There's a lot to uncover, we find mushrooms and begin inspecting them. There's also a broken lock and a rune key with weird symbols.
 
With our choices exhausted, it's time to head back to the original scenery and continue our search with the brand-new assortment of clues we found. Will the knife help us pry something open? The answer is yes!
 
It seems there is something we missed. Close to the underground entry, there is a small crack, and it seems something has been kept inside the crack. We could use the wire from the coin to pull it out.
 
Maybe the small Wizard could help us undo the curse on Maaron? Apparently, the passage to the academy doesn't work. The first tutorial bit is over, and we're finally at the stage where tasks are being displayed.
 
Now, this is where the game will start playing itself. You'll find missing pieces, new fellows, and a lot more. The key here is to keep investigating every scene thoroughly and you will be well on your way to a successful path.

In Lost Lands 8, every item you come across can be valuable. You should thoroughly explore each scene and interact with as many objects as possible. Sometimes, items that seem insignificant can play an important role later in the game.
 
For example, small objects like keys, coins, or pieces of paper might be easily overlooked, but they often are essential for unlocking new areas or solving puzzles. Additionally, some items can be combined with others to create new tools or solutions.
 
Also, dialogue and narrative elements often can contain subtle hints or crucial information about puzzle solutions. So, listen and read carefully, and try to connect the story elements with the gameplay.
 
This feature is especially helpful in a game with a vast world and multiple locations. For instance, if you're unsure where to go next, the map might show icons or markers in areas where tasks are incomplete or new events have been triggered.
 
The puzzles often require creative thinking and the unconventional use of items in Lost Lands 8. The key is to experiment with your inventory. For example, an item that seems to have a specific purpose might actually be part of the solution to a completely different puzzle.
 
If an item has been in your inventory for a while, reconsider its potential uses, as its purpose may not be immediately obvious. This approach encourages exploration and experimentation, which are at the heart of solving many puzzles in the game.
 
Lost Lands 8 can present a complex narrative with intricate puzzles and a multitude of items. Keeping notes is not just a suggestion but almost a necessity. Documenting your findings, puzzle clues, and item locations can be incredibly helpful.
 
Rushing through these puzzles can cause you to miss essential items in Lost Lands 8. If a HOP seems particularly challenging, take a break and return later with fresh eyes, as this can sometimes make it easier to spot the objects you missed initially.
 
Lost Lands 8 includes a hint system designed to assist players when they're stuck. While this feature can be incredibly helpful, it's important to use it sparingly to maintain the game's challenge and satisfaction.
 
Relying too much on hints can take away from the sense of accomplishment that comes from solving puzzles independently. Try to exhaust your own problem-solving skills and strategies first before resorting to a hint.
 
This approach encourages you to develop and refine your puzzle-solving abilities, which is a significant part of the game's appeal. Besides, overuse of the hint system can make the gameplay less engaging and rewarding.
