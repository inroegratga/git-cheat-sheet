What format are your LUTs in? I just tried this on my iPad and it does appear to be a bit hit and miss as it took a couple of attempts of importing the LUTs on my iPad before it would show in the app. However, I've tried it on another iPad and they showed straight away.
 
I've just had this confirmed this is a bug and I've logged it with the Developers. You might find if you keep trying they will appear, as I did have this work once but all other attempts I've made have failed.

@stokerg: I am finding that I cannot use Import LUT on a LUTs category, but I need to do some more testing. My LUT (.cube) files are on a network drive. I can tap Import LUT and get the Files dialog. I can navigate to the network drive, and to the folder I want to import from. The .cube files are all displayed, and I can select them and click Open. But they do not show up in the LUT category in the Adjustments panel list.

I've been poking this some more and I've zero idea how I got my LUT imported once, as all other attempts have failed, thats with LUTs stored locally and on iCloud. I've also checked this with QA and they are also having the same trouble, can select the LUT but it's not added to the Adjustment Panel and have requested I get this logged with the Developers, which I'll do straight after my lunch
 
I have the same trouble with adding luts too. Can select the .cube(s) but it's not added to the Adjustment. Tried rename to .cub .3dl, re-copy files, reinstall, reset ipad os... nothing works. Hope to find out soon.
 
Import LUT glitch: RESOLVED! I was having a problem importing a LUT to my iPad. The LUT that I created would not show up in the list under adjustments/LUT like it is supposed to. It did however work perfectly on my husband's iPad which is the exact same as mine. I couldn't figure out why it was working on his but not on mine. 

 
I discovered that I was exporting my newly created LUT and saving it in my iCloud affinity photo folder (which is what the book I purchased told me to do). That was the problem. Once I figured out to save the exported LUT into a folder on my iPad, then I was able to import it and have it show up in the list. It worked perfect when importing it from my iPad folder. I now have the new LUT imported and it shows up on the list of adjustments/LUT for every photo that I open. 

 

I have a problem with my Premiere Pro 2020. I have more than 3000 luts but on luts dropdown list i can only see a limited number of luts. U can see the screenshot below. I installed them to the correct folder (C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Common\LUTs\Creative)
To see all my luts in the drop down list what can i do?

I've no freaking clue how anyone would build a library of 3,000 LUTs or what in the world you'd use them all for. Sorting/searching would take longer than doing something without the LUT, and anyway ... as colorists say, LUTs are the dumbest math out there. Absolutely necessary at times, but ... need to be used with caution after extensive testing.
 
I have the same problem here. Copy LUTs to C:\Program Files\Adobe\Common\LUTs\Creative. They just don't appear all in the drop down menu.
I purchase 1947+ PREMIUM LUTS pack from Studio Planet, only around 200 LUTs presets appear. There's no way to see & choose the rest
 
But again, we're all different. I've argued with the developers that they should allow subfolders to show in the Basic & Creative tab slots, so one could have collapsed subfolders and get through the sorting a lot faster. They find it an " ... interesting ... " idea. I'd just like to see it done. And in that, make it so if someone wants 1,000 LUTs, they can.
 
I've also argued for moving the Basic tab's LUT slot to the bottom of the tab, where for proper application/processing order it should be. So you can drop a LUT on, then trim before that LUT for best use of it. Now, you have to use the Creative tab, and I don't ever recommend using the Basic tab's slot. Too much chance of clipped, crushed, or wrongly saturated pixels.
 
I have been adding in LUTs for both cameras to footage as I correct it, and then adjusting Lumetri settings. Generally when I apply the lut there is no issue, I can see the footage in the program monitor.
 
As I continue to work, if I go back to previously corrected footage, certain clips no longer show in program monitor. Screens are black. However, if I open the clip in source monitor, it shows fine. If I toggle off the Lumetri, they come back into view in Program monitor (not always). If I restart the project and computer, certain clips stop having that problem, but others start having it. I have not had a whole error-free play through since using the LUTs, so I'm worried I'm missing something with my method of application. My friend who made the files has no issues.
 
A lot of these issues are caused when the same LUTs are not installed on multiple systems or across multiple user accounts. That said, since 12.1, there is a new way to add multiple LUTs to a Premiere Pro installation. Create folders for your LUTs, drop them in, then restart Premiere Pro. I hope this helps.
 
Thanks Jim! I am applying the non-adobe Luts via Browse. I keep them in a dropbox folder that syncs to both machines so they are literally the same luts applied as well. I'm not adding any luts to the premiere folder structure.
 
When I switch between computers, I use an external HD with the exact same footage and project folder layout, so nothing changes there but the cache folder which is always set to C:/cache so I can easily find and clear.
 
Per my comments to Jim just now, I keep the project, including LUTS, in a dropbox that syncs to both machines and have all the footage on an identical external drive. I never open the project on two machines at once, either. So the same luts (or exact copies) are being applied to the project, and both machines are showing the issue of dropping to black in program monitor.
 
By toggling h.264 acceleration, do you mean GPU vs. Software only rendering? If not, can you let me know what you mean by this or how to do it? I have toggled to Software only rendering, and it left me with a red checkered screen on many clips instead of a black program monitor.
 
Could I keep the Luts in a better place than the project folder with the project inside of it? Maybe the switching editing machines has gotten the paths confused even though they are in the same place, I can see if this works on Machine 1 in a few hours.
 
I'm having the same issue but the fix above didn't help. I tried clearing the previews and browsing to the LUT in the common folder but the program monitor still shows black when the LUT is applied. Same with an adjustment layer.
 
I did, I also removed all LUTs from the folder within the package contents of Premiere. I didn't do this for AE and it's showing two copies of each LUT so it's definitely pulling from the common folder.
 
You got me on this one ... that's not something that's happening much, and well ... if the movement of LUTs to their new "proper" home, or making sure the video card drivers are up-to-date don't fix this, and dumping cache & preferences don't, the only thing I've got left to suggest is using the Adobe CC Cleaner Tool to both uninstall and clean up after PrPro.
 
In case anyone revisits this thread with the same problem it turns out the issue was an underpowered GPU. After many attempted fixes including updating to Premiere 2019 all Lumetri actions had the black screen effect, not just applying LUTs which made me take a look at the video card. After swapping out the 2GB card for a 3GB the problem went away. Probably still underpowered but it's got enough juice to get me through this project at least. Thanks for the help.
 
I'm having the same issues on my macbook pro I tried the solution above, dropping my .look in a LUT that I created in the Common folder but it does not work. 
What is weird is that on another computer (iMac), for the same .look file, it does work.

Do we have to add LUTs (.cub files) individually by saving them again inside Vegas 19 pro standalone??
I have vegas pro 19 standalone. How do I add (import) more than one LUT at a time if at all possible? I understand in vegas 18 I would have selected a clip and add media fx, choose LUT or select default LUT, alt
