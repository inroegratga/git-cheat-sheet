The algorithm parameters are: user's rating, number of resolved issues, number of company's responses etc. The algorithm is subject to change in future.
 
I have a couple of customers who are experiencing the same problem. The first channel on the phone app says "Failed to connect...Incorrect channel number". All of the other cameras connect on the app. All of the cameras are fine on the NVR as well as from a web browser. I have the systems loaded on my phone with no issues at all.

I have access to local distributor service team will talk and get back. For you also is it on iPhone or Android?. In my case I am able to see the first camera in my Android phone but not able to see on my customers iPhone.
 
All of the instances have been iphones. however, on those instances, it was only one iphone. Out of three iphones accessing the same system, same network, same time, it is always just one iphone with the issue. And it is only when connecting on the LAN. The missing camera will work when switching that iphone to its LTE connection.
 
Had this issue again today with two iPhone 6 pluses. This time I deleted the device and re-entered it and it worked! I have tried to delete the app in the past but never just deleted the device in the app. Anxious to try this on the other customers with the same issue. Try this and let me know your results please.
 
I have a problem with two access control panels, one is Hikvision and the other one is a ZKTeco CCA-400, those two panels see the Wiegand card in a different way, this is a big problem because I cannot import cards from ZKteco to Hikvision or the other way around.
 
I searched and couldn't figure it out, so in my pursuit to debug this issue I connected a Wiegand reader to a Arduino UNO just to see that is coming on the wire from the reader, the results just made the problem even confusing:

It sounds like the difference in what you are seeing is the **two parity bits**. Each half of the number encoded into the card has its own parity bit, with one half odd parity, and the other half even parity. In addition to detecting read errors, these two bits allow detection of use of a Wiegand card normally vs. upside-down.
 
You might check that by determining the reaction of the two devices to running the card through with the front side toward the back. My guess would be the one that only reports 24-bits may ignore reversed reads, but the other might report a different number (with bits reversed from the first one.)
 
I worked for Kastle Systems on what was probably the first commercial application of Wiegand cards for security almost 40 years ago. The parity scheme was similar to that used on UPC barcode readers. I see there are still documents out on the web describing the, Wiegand Kastle format 32-bit format, which looks like it may be helpful to you.
 
Conclusion:Hikvision correctly converts the card to Wiegand 26 format ( facility code + card id ), ZKTeco instead converts the entire card number to decimal directly without splitting the facility id / card id.
 
Automatic Number Plate Recognition, also known as ANPR, describes the process of digitally finding or reading the number plates of vehicles. This technology is becoming increasingly popular and accurate, particularly as intelligent vehicle management is becoming a vital part of many industries.
 
The ability to identify vehicles through their license plates can be a highly beneficial tool for a broad spectrum of applications. For government bodies through to small businesses and everything in between, there are countless uses for the technology and many different advantages.
 
The Hikvision algorithm will examine an image or video feed and highlight anything that matches these conditions. So even if an object only looks like it could be a license plate, it may still be picked up by this initial search.
 
Having found the correct plate, the algorithm fine-tunes its selection in preparation for reading the characters. To do this effectively, it passes on the work to another simple algorithm designed by Hikvision specifically to detect characters. The result of this is shown in the image below.
 
Uncontrollable factors like digital noise, camera perspective, lighting conditions, etc, can all greatly impact the readability of characters. As such, partitioning is an essential step for feeding the algorithm information it can understand and accurately read.
 
As mention earlier, Hikvision ANPR technology has a broad spectrum of applications. With uses ranging from monitoring the flow of heavy machinery in industrial sites through to parking enforcement for small businesses. Hikvision ANPR is a truly versatile piece of tech.
 
Hikvision ANPR cameras are a popular choice for law enforcement and other miscellaneous government bodies. Within Australia, NSW was the first to trial ANPR technology back in 2005. Their ability to autonomously read license plates can be invaluable for sniffing out unregistered or stolen vehicles, disqualified or suspended drivers, vehicles of interest, etc.
 
In addition to law enforcement, ANPR cameras can be used for traffic control in car parks, highways, streets, and other such thoroughfares. In such applications, these surveillance cameras can deliver valuable and accurate data. This includes the usage of particular roads, areas of high and low congestion, electronic toll management and collection, and the frequency, location and cause of road works.
 
ANPR can also be used for live entrance and exit management and blacklist or VIP list notifications. This feature can be particularly useful for casinos, airports, hotels, or practically any other entity that might want to identify specific vehicles.
 
At iCam Security Services, we are Diamond Partners with Hikvision Australia. We stock a range of Hikvision ANPR cameras and an ANPR CCTV kit. If you're looking to buy Hikvision with ANPR functionality, these are the products for you.
