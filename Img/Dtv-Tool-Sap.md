To date, the band has released five studio albums, one EP and one box set. It emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, *Undertow* (1993), and became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement with the release of their follow-up album *nima* in 1996. The group's efforts to combine musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued with *Lateralus* (2001) and *10,000 Days* (2006), gaining critical acclaim and international commercial success. Its fifth studio album *Fear Inoculum* was released on August 30, 2019, to widespread critical acclaim. Prior to its release, the band had sold more than 13 million albums in the US alone.[2]
 
Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band has been described as a style-transcending act and part of progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and art rock. The relationship between the band and the music industry is ambivalent, at times marked by censorship, and the band's insistence on privacy.
 
During the 1980s, each of the future members of Tool moved to Los Angeles. Both Paul D'Amour and Adam Jones wanted to enter the film industry, while Maynard James Keenan, who had studied visual arts in Michigan, worked as a pet store remodeler.[3] Danny Carey and Keenan performed for Green Jell,[3] and Carey played with Carole King and Pigmy Love Circus.[4]
 
Keenan and Jones met through a mutual friend in 1989.[5] After Keenan played Jones a tape recording of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming a new band.[5] They started jamming together while searching for a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by Tom Morello, an old high school friend of Jones and former member of Electric Sheep.[6] Carey began playing in their sessions because he "felt kinda sorry for them", as other invited musicians were not showing up.[7] Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced the members to bassist D'Amour.[8] Early on, the band fabricated the story that it formed because of the pseudophilosophy "lachrymology".[9] Although "lachrymology" was also cited as an inspiration for the band's name, Keenan later explained the members' intentions differently: "Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It's a big dick. It's a wrench. ... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out whatever it is you need to find out, or whatever it is you're trying to achieve."[10]

After almost two years of practicing and performing locally in the Los Angeles area, the band was approached by record companies,[5] and eventually signed a record deal with Zoo Entertainment.[8] In March 1992, Zoo released the band's first effort, *Opiate*. Described by the band as "slam and bang" heavy music[11] and the "hardest sounding" six songs they had written to that point,[12] the EP included the singles "Hush" and "Opiate". The band's first music video, "Hush", promoted their dissenting views about the then-prominent Parents Music Resource Center and its advocacy of the censorship of music. The video featured the band members naked with their genitalia covered by Parental Advisory stickers and their mouths covered by duct tape.[13] The band began touring with Rollins Band, Fishbone, Rage Against the Machine, White Zombie, and Corrosion of Conformity,[14][15][16] to positive responses, which Janiss Garza of *RIP Magazine* summarized in September 1992 as a "buzz" and "a strong start".[17]
 
The following year, at a time when alternative rock and grunge were at their height, Tool released their first full-length album, *Undertow* (1993). It expressed more diverse dynamics than *Opiate* and included songs the band had chosen not to publish on their previous release, when they had opted for a heavier sound.[12] The band began touring again as planned, with an exception in May 1993. Tool was scheduled to play at the Garden Pavilion in Hollywood but learned at the last minute that the venue belonged to the Church of Scientology, which was perceived as a clash with "the band's ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts their development as a human being."[14] Keenan "spent most of the show baa-ing like a sheep at the audience."[19]
 
Tool later played several concerts during the Lollapalooza festival tour, and was moved from the second stage to the main stage by the group's manager and the festival co-founder Ted Gardner.[22] At the last concert of Lollapalooza in Tool's hometown Los Angeles, comedian Bill Hicks introduced the band. Hicks had become a friend of the band members and an influence on them after being mentioned in *Undertow'*s liner notes.[23] He jokingly asked the audience of 10,000 people to stand still and help him look for a lost contact lens.[24] The boost in popularity gained from these concerts helped *Undertow* to be certified gold by the RIAA in September 1993 and to achieve platinum status in 1995,[25] despite being sold with censored album artwork by distributors such as Wal-Mart.[26][27] The single "Sober" became a hit single by March 1994 and won the band *Billboard*'s "Best Video by a New Artist" award for the accompanying stop motion music video.[12]
 
With the release of Tool's follow-up single "Prison Sex", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with child abuse, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: "It took so long to remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed and my throat wide open." The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his "surrealistic interpretation" of the subject matter.[28] While some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as "metaphoric",[13][18] the American branch of MuchMusic (which asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing) deemed the music video too graphic and obscene,[14] and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.[18]
 
In September 1995, the band began writing and recording its second studio album. At that time Tool experienced its only lineup change to date, with bassist D'Amour leaving the band amicably to pursue other projects. According to Carey, D'Amour left the band because he wanted to play guitar rather than bass.[29] Justin Chancellor, a member of former tourmate band Peach, eventually replaced D'Amour during the recording of the album, having been chosen over competitors such as Kyuss's Scott Reeder, Filter's Frank Cavanaugh, Pigmy Love Circus's E. Shepherd Stevenson, Jane's Addiction's Eric Avery, and ZAUM's Marco Fox.[30]
 
On September 17, 1996, Tool released its second full-length album, *nima* ("ON-ima").[31] The band enlisted the help of producer David Bottrill, who had produced some of King Crimson's albums, while Jones collaborated with Cam de Leon to create *nima*'s Grammy-nominated artwork.[32][33] The album was dedicated to stand-up comedian Bill Hicks, who died two-and-a-half years earlier.[14] The band intended to raise awareness about Hicks's material and ideas, because they felt that Tool and Hicks "were resonating similar concepts".[34] In particular, *nima*'s final track "Third Eye" is preceded by a clip of Hicks' performances, and the lenticular casing of the *nima* album packaging as well as the chorus of the title track "nema" make reference to a sketch from Hicks's *Arizona Bay*, in which he contemplates the idea of Los Angeles falling into the Pacific Ocean.[34][35]
 
The first single, "Stinkfist", garnered limited airplay. It was shortened by radio programmers, MTV (U.S.) renamed the music video of "Stinkfist" to "Track No. 1" due to offensive connotations,[36] and the lyrics of the song were altered.[37] Responding to fan complaints about censorship, Matt Pinfield of MTV's *120 Minutes* expressed regret on air by waving his fist in front of his face while introducing the video and explaining the name change.[36]
 
A tour began in October 1996, two weeks after *nima*'s release. Following numerous appearances in the United States and Europe, Tool headed for Australia and New Zealand in late March 1997. Eventually returning to the United States, Tool appeared at Lollapalooza '97 in July, this time as a headliner, where they gained critical praise from *The New York Times*.[38] *nima* eventually matched Tool's successful debut album in sales,[39] and the progressive-influenced album landed the band at the head of the alternative metal genre. It featured the Grammy Award-winning "nema"[40] and appeared on "Best Albums of 1996" lists in *Kerrang!*[41] and *Terrorizer*.[42] It was eventually certified triple platinum by the RIAA on March 4, 2003.[43] In 1998, Tool joined the Ozzfest tour in the United States as the co-headliner act before Ozzy Osbourne.[44] The band accepted on the condition that Melvins had to join it as well because, as stated by its frontman Buzz Osborne, they "wanted at least one band on the tour that they liked", despite the dissuasions from the tour organizers.[45]
 
The album became a worldwide success, reaching No.1 on the U.S. *Billboard* 200 albums chart in its debut week.[64] Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for
