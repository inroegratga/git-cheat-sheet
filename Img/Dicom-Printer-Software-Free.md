Hence, despite the great advantages of digital imaging and sharing, printing on a radiology film or even on a normal paper is still a widely used way to share the images.

@pieper I checked the links and there are seemingly some codes available here and there for dicom printing. Hence, if someone knows the back-end code of slicer3d, this might not be so time-consuming. According to my experience, dicom printing on radiology films is still used (mainly in dental imaging). But paper printing is more common in radiology of other organs.
 
The free PACS Conquest is able to print to both DICOM and paper printers so you could process the files in Slicer and then send as DICOM to Conquest for printing. There are many options in Conquest for automatic processing of incoming files.
 
DICOM Printer 2 is a virtual printer and application that helps you send documents or images directly to PACS or print them to DICOM film. DP2 can combine a multitude of actions into powerful DICOM workflows.
 
**UP-D77MD DICOM Color Printer. The UP-D77MD DICOM Color Printer is a full page digital color printer designed specifically for nuclear medicine, PET/CT and 3D-CT applications where accurate color reproduction is essential. An integrated digital DICOM interface enables this reliable dye sublimation printer to be connected directly to DICOM imaging systems or to any DICOM network. The combination of the 300 dpi high resolution thermal head and premium Sony print media results in outstanding photo-realistic image quality. Prints from the UP-D77MD are also highly durable since the media includes unique, built-in protective lamination. Utilizing an advanced color management tool, the color output can be fine-tuned to match a monitor display without altering grayscale values for accurate color reproduction. These settings can be adjusted for each specific modality and can be easily copied to other UP-D77MD printers.**

You can configure a DICOM film printer in InteleViewer.When setting it up, you must be certain that the settings followthe printer's supported configurations. Otherwise, you may get errormessages when printing images to film.

film contains columns with equal size rectangular image boxes with C1 image boxes in the first column, C2 image boxes in second column, C3 image boxes in third column, etc.; C1, C2, C3, etc. are integers
 
film contains a customized ordering of rectangular image boxes; i identifies the image display format; the definition of the image display formats is defined in the Conformance Statement; i is an integer
 
Character string that contains either the ID of the printer configuration table that contains a set of values for implementation specific print parameters (e.g., perception LUT related parameters) or one or more configuration data values, encoded as characters. If there are multiple configuration data values encoded in the string, they shall be separated by backslashes. The definition of values shall be contained in the SCP's Conformance Statement.
 
Luminance of lightbox illuminating a piece of transmissive film, or for the case of reflective media, luminance obtainable from diffuse reflection of the illumination present. Expressed as L0, in candelas per square meter (cd/m2).
 
The standard format subdivides a film into image boxes of equal size. Therefore, the film layout is fully symmetrical, i.e., the arrangement of image boxes on film is left-right and top-bottom symmetric.
 
The row symmetric image display format subdivides a film into rows of image boxes of equal size. As a result, the layout is left-right symmetric, the associated symmetry line is vertical (V). There is no top-bottom symmetry.
 
The column symmetric image display format subdivides a film into columns of image boxes of equal size. As a result, the layout is top-button symmetric, the associated symmetry line is horizontal (H). There is no left-right symmetry.
 
A sequence that provides the content of the grayscale image pixel data to be printed. This is a specialization of the Image Pixel Module defined in Section C.7.6.3. It is encoded as a sequence of Attributes of the Image Pixel Module.

The position of the image on the film; the encoding of the image position sequence is based on the selected Image Display Format (2010,0010). The image position sequence shall be increasing order beginning with the value 1. Image Box Position (2020,0010) is defined as follows:
 
Contains printer configuration information for a single Application Entity title. See Print Management Service Class Structure in PS3.4. The sequence shall contain one item for each physical printer/Meta SOP Class combination supported by the Application Entity title.
 
A sequence that specifies combinations of Medium Type and Film Size ID for which the printer will accept an N-CREATE of a Film Box, but are not physically installed in the printer at this time. It also specifies the Min and Max Densities supported by these media. User intervention may be required to instal these media in the printer.
 
A sequence that specifies the Image Display Formats supported, rows and columns in Image Boxes for each format, pixel spacing, and whether Requested Image Size is supported as a function of Film Orientation, Film Size ID, and Printer Resolution ID.
 
Physical distance on the printed film between the center of each pixel, specified by a numeric pair - adjacent row spacing (delimiter) adjacent column spacing in mm. See Section 10.7.1.3 for further explanation of the value order.
 
How to configure EzDent-i to use a DICOM printer for true 1:1 Printing.



Note: Please note that printing to non - Medical Grade Dicom printers such as Injet, or other printers can not be garunteed to be true 1:1. Measuring from a printed image is highly advised against, as variations in printers and print settings printer to printer will not produce proper 1:1 accuracy.
 
Many hospitals, clinics and radiology centers have adopted new digital medical imaging technologies, PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems) and VNA (Vendor Neutral Archive) systems for diagnostics through monitors or workstations; however there still remains a need to print images on radiographic films to provide a study copy to the patients. Digital modalities such as CT scan, MRI, ultrasound and digital radiology usually print medical images on radiographic film, which is more expensive to acquire, store and ship. In addition, radiographic film uses expensive laser film printers embedded with the DICOM protocol.
 
The RICOH DICOM solution is revolutionary in the practice of radiology because it makes possible the affordable printing of advanced medical imaging applications throughout different stages of the patient care process, from the emergency area service to a routine testing, all in a RICOH printer. The replication includes the design (1x1, 1x2, 2x1, 2x2, 2x3, etc.), edge color, film orientation, equipment boxes, and empty image densities which results in users having the possibility of printing an image of high quality on plain paper at a much lower cost.
 
DICOM images are imported into the D2P stand-alone modular software package that consolidates all 3D model segmentation and preparation steps into one workstation. D2P is a cleared medical device intended for pre-operative surgical planning and the production of 3D-printed anatomic models for diagnostic purposes.
 
The unique image segmentation tool set and its advanced virtual reality (VR) visualization allow clinicians and point-of-care (POC) staff to minimize the effort and time associated with the creation of patient-specific anatomic models.
 
While D2P will export digital files compatible with 3D printers from most manufacturers, the combination of D2P and 3D Systems printers offers a 510(K)-cleared solution that allows users to 3D print diagnostic-quality models. When printed using selected materials, these 3D models can be sterilized and are biocompatible. See the D2P regulatory information page for more information on the cleared printers and materials.
 
aycan's xray-print solution lets you print radiological and other medical images on plain paper (vs. film) at near diagnostic quality to reduce medical hardcopy cost by 90%. The solution fits seamlessly into both traditional and PACS workflows.
 
Hospitals (radiology departments) and imaging centers are making the transition to digital with the goal to be filmless and therefore reduce cost. But referring physicians are still asking for hardcopy images together with the report (diagnosis).
