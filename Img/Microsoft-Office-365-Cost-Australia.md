If you're firmly in the Microsoft camp, then this is where you'll be able to save some cash on the retail price of the subscription-based Microsoft 365 software (formerly called Office 365) and the available-to-buy-outright Microsoft Office 2021.

If a subscription service isn't your thing, you can still get access to the important Office suite apps with a one-off payment when you get this Office 2021 package. This is a significant saving on the official AU$199 price at the Microsoft Store, so don't miss out.
 
If you're looking to buy Microsoft 365, you should know that this is a subscription-based service. The prices displayed below are for monthly subscriptions, but you can pay per year, which will cost you AU$99 and AU$129 for the annual Personal and Family plans respectively.

The **Personal** plan is for a single user licenced for use on just one PC, along with a tablet or mobile, while the **Family** bundle is for up to six users. The former comes with just 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage, while the latter comes with up to 6TB of storage and some additional features in the mobile version. Of course, access to all the latest Microsoft Office suite is also included in both versions, no exceptions.
 
Cloud storage is particularly useful for editing documents on the go. So you could go from writing on the laptop/desktop to making a few changes or crucial last minute updates on your mobile or tablet.
 
If the online cloud storage and device switching won't be useful, we'd recommend scrolling further down this page and consider buying either **Microsoft Office Home & Student 2021** or **Microsoft Office Home and Student 2019** instead for a one-off fee but you won't get any updates.
 
There are four different Microsoft 365 Business plans available in Australia. Microsoft says that it changed the name "to be more reflective of the range of features and benefits in the subscription. Microsoft 365 includes everything you know in Office 365, including best-in-class Office apps, intelligent cloud services, and advanced security."
 
Microsoft certainly took its time to give us a new standalone Office package as it's moved its focus to the Microsoft 365 subscription service nowadays. But if you want a modern version of Office with only a one-time fee, this is the way to go.
 
You don't get the fancier cloud-based features and multi-device support that you do with Microsoft 365, but this can work out much cheaper in the long run, setting you AU$199 for the suite and no recurring costs.
 
Keep in mind that Microsoft Office 2021 only allows one user to work on a single PC or Mac, with access to only the 'classic' versions of the apps, not the 'premium' ones you get with a 365 subscription.
 
As is usually the case, the cheapest option for a Microsoft Office suite would be an older version if you can lay your hands on it. It's no longer available on the Australian Microsoft Store but you may be able to find it at other retailers.
 
Like the Office 2021 suite, this edition is also just a single-user licence, allowing you to install the apps on one device only, for a one-time payment. It still comes with all the essential Office apps that are suitable for most user's needs: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Access, Publisher and OneNote.

Microsoft Planner is an included app with a business version of Microsoft 365, an ecosystem of office productivity applications. The browser- and mobile-based program is more of a task management app than project management app, but it can be useful for users of Microsoft products. In our Microsoft Planner review, we spent hours researching the features, functionality, ease of use and support for the app.
 
At Forbes Advisor, we try to get hands-on experience as users with all software we review. In this case, we were able to test an account, but not one of our own due to Microsoft failing to respond to our requests for help. We were able to test customer support, which you can read about below. With that in mind, we were not able to share the initial experience after signing up for an account, but we are able to provide a thorough rundown of all that Microsoft Planner has to offer.
 
Microsoft Planner is a task management tool included in the Microsoft 365 subscription for businesses. It natively integrates with other Microsoft products, such as Word, Excel and Teams, making it a good solution for businesses already using Microsoft 365.
 
Microsoft introduced Planner in 2016 as part of its Microsoft 365 app ecosystem. The purpose of the app is to provide task management features for Microsoft business users. It also gets added functionality with other Microsoft products, such as Word and Excel for document creation and collaboration and Teams for communication.
 
At its core, Microsoft Planner is a task management application. You can easily create to-do lists, checklists and projects. The Kanban, charts and calendar views are intuitive for anyone to use and give a clear view of the tasks at hand. Although the features are fewer than other project management tools, they are effective for simple projects.
 
It took years for Microsoft to add a task assignment feature. Now you can create a task and assign it to a user either via Planner or Teams. Even more helpful is that you can assign a task to multiple users (up to 11). You cannot separate sections of a task, though. So if one person marks a task as complete, it marks it as complete for all users.
 
Access to Microsoft Planner is only available through the subscription of one of Microsoft Office 365 business plans. Pricing starts at $6 per user per month (billed annually). There is a free 30-day trial available of any of the plans, but you must provide payment information to start the trial.
 
If you need more access control and management for better security, the Premium plan grants this feature plus enterprise-grade level security. Other features include device management, so you can remove business data from devices as needed.
 
To get started, create a new plan and the app will open in the Kanban board view. Microsoft refers to the columns on the board as buckets. Simply click the plus sign under a bucket to create a task card. Fill out information and then assign the task to users.
 
The highest-tier plan offers advanced security features, such as stronger security to protect against ransomware and phishing attacks. You can also delete sensitive information from business devices as needed, such as when an employee leaves the company or a device is lost or stolen.
 
A final attempt was made to contact support but we never got through and no one ever returned a call. We did get an email days later and scheduled a call, but no one followed up after several weeks of waiting.
 
Microsoft Planner is a simple task management tool that lets you track tasks and due dates. Microsoft Project is more of a project management app with more functionality for tracking tasks, dependencies, costs and milestones.
 
Unlike rival suites, Microsoft 365 has native apps for every important platform except Linux. The full suite runs as a set of subscription-based desktop apps in Windows and macOS, with free mobile versions on iOS and Android and free web-based versions for any browser, making the suite available via the web for any platform, including Linux. Subscriptions include an email account. A one-person subscription, Microsoft 365 Personal, costs $69.99 per year for use in Windows, macOS, phones, and tablets, signed in to five devices at once. The more economical Microsoft 365 Family costs $99.99 for up to six people, with up to 5 devices each signed in simultaneously. Business users can choose from various plans, starting with Microsoft 365 Business Basic for $6 per user per month, with web and mobile apps but no desktop software. From there, it goes up to Microsoft 365 Business Premium, which includes desktop software, at $22 per user per month.
