I have read and tested a simple case using the v12 documentation. This works fine for extending a class directly and having the custom property available in the view, but it does not seem to be available if the model is inherited by something else.

With fresh Monday morning brain I at least realized when writing up the View I could just cast the Model.Settings as the IInterface instead of the actual Settings model and be able to access the custom property... But obviously that's not perfect when the component Settings could have its own properties or other compositions to access.
 
My current solution is just having multiple casts of the settings each pointed toward the required IInterface extended classes so that I can access the composed custom properties. Having re-read the documentation I think I misinterpreted the initial 'bad practice' example with model inheritance and thought it was bad bad bad to have multiple model casts.

Although dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is widely used in clinical research as a means of quantifying body composition, there remains at present little published information that reviews the method's underlying physical basis. Because a clear understanding of DXA physical concepts is integral to appropriate use and interpretation, we present here a three-section review that includes both relevant in vitro and in vivo experimental demonstrations. In the first section we describe the main physical principles on which DXA is based. The section that follows presents a step-by-step analysis of the DXA two-component soft tissue model. In the final section we demonstrate how knowledge of physical concepts can lead to resolution of important methodological concerns, such as the influence of hydration changes on DXA fat estimates. A thorough understanding of DXA physical concepts provides a basis for appropriate interpretation of measurement results and stimulates many new and important research questions.

CONCLUSION: Relative to criterion fat estimates, body composition methods can be organized into three groups based on inter-method comparisons including technical error, coefficient of reliability and Bland-Altman analysis. These initial groupings may prove useful in establishing the clinical and research role of the many available fat estimation methods.

Abstract. A new version of the Global Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP) is described, which uses a two-moment pseudo-modal aerosol dynamics approach rather than the original two-moment bin scheme. GLOMAP-mode simulates the multi-component global aerosol, resolving sulfate, sea-salt, dust, black carbon (BC) and particulate organic matter (POM), the latter including primary and biogenic secondary POM. Aerosol processes are simulated in a size-resolved manner including primary emissions, secondary particle formation by binary homogeneous nucleation of sulfuric acid and water, particle growth by coagulation, condensation and cloud-processing and removal by dry deposition, in-cloud and below-cloud scavenging. A series of benchmark observational datasets are assembled against which the skill of the model is assessed in terms of normalised mean bias (*b*) and correlation coefficient (*R*). Overall, the model performs well against the datasets in simulating concentrations of aerosol precursor gases, chemically speciated particle mass, condensation nuclei (CN) and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Surface sulfate, sea-salt and dust mass concentrations are all captured well, while BC and POM are biased low (but correlate well). Surface CN concentrations compare reasonably well in free troposphere and marine sites, but are underestimated at continental and coastal sites related to underestimation of either primary particle emissions or new particle formation. The model compares well against a compilation of CCN observations covering a range of environments and against vertical profiles of size-resolved particle concentrations over Europe. The simulated global burden, lifetime and wet removal of each of the simulated aerosol components is also examined and each lies close to multi-model medians from the AEROCOM model intercomparison exercise.
 
createCompositionAsModel(ar,CompositionName) creates a Simulink model corresponding to AUTOSAR software composition CompositionName. The composition description is part of AUTOSAR information previously imported from AUTOSAR XML files, which is represented by arxml.importer object ar.The importer creates an initial Simulink representation of the imported AUTOSAR composition. The initial representation provides a starting point for further AUTOSAR configuration and Model-Based Design. For more information, see AUTOSAR ARXML Importer.
 
For each imported component, the importer stores sharable AUTOSAR properties, such as interfaces and data types, in data dictionary ardata.sldd. Components within the composition can then share the stored properties.
 
To view the shared properties, open the AUTOSAR dictionary for a component model. This example opens ThrottlePositionSensor. Expand the AUTOSAR dictionary node ardata.sldd. You can view read-only properties, such as shared component interfaces, and modify XML options for composition and component export.
 
Names of existing atomic software component models to use when creating a Simulink representation of the composition. The function incorporates the specified existing component models in the composition model instead of creating new ones.
 
Simulink data dictionary into which to import data objects corresponding to AUTOSAR data types in the XML file. If the specified dictionary does not already exist, the importer creates it. The model is then associated with that data dictionary.
 
If you specify true for the 'ShareAUTOSARProperties' argument, the specified data dictionary also stores sharable AUTOSAR properties, such as interfaces and data types, for sharing among components in the composition.
 
By default, createCompositionAsModel imports AUTOSAR periodic runnables found in ARXML files and attempts to model them as atomic subsystems with periodic rates. If conditions prevent use of atomic subsystems, the function models the periodic runnables as function-call subsystems with periodic rates.
 
Path to a PredefinedVariant defined in the AUTOSAR XML file. A PredefinedVariant describes a combination of system constant values among potentially multiple valid combinations to apply to AUTOSAR software components. Use this argument to resolve variation points in AUTOSAR software components at model creation time. If specified, the importer uses the PredefinedVariant to initialize SwSystemconst data that serves as input to control variation points.
 
To improve the performance of common tasks in AUTOSAR composition modeling, composition import can store sharable component properties, such as interfaces and data types, into a Simulink data dictionary. Components within the composition can then share the stored properties.
 
For compositions containing more than 20 software components, sharing AUTOSAR properties among components can significantly improve performance for composition workflows, including import, dictionary navigation, AUTOSAR validation, and code generation. Limiting property replication among components can reduce component model file sizes.
 
The shared AUTOSAR dictionary provides a central location for viewing and configuring AUTOSAR composition and component properties. You can view read-only properties, such as shared component interfaces, and modify XML options for composition and component export.
 
To share AUTOSAR properties, specify true. For each imported component, the function stores sharable AUTOSAR properties, such as interfaces and data types, in the Simulink data dictionary specified by the 'DataDictionary' argument. The 'DataDictionary' argument must be specified.
 
Paths to one or more SystemConstValueSets defined in the AUTOSAR XML file. A SystemConstValueSet specifies a set of system constant values to apply to AUTOSAR software components. Use this argument to resolve variation points in AUTOSAR software components at model creation time. If specified, the importer uses the SystemConstValueSets to initialize SwSystemconst data that serves as input to control variation points.
 
If you enter the arxml.importer object function call without a terminating semicolon (;), the importer lists the AUTOSAR content of the specified XML file or files. The information includes paths to software components in the AUTOSAR package structure, which you can specify in calls to createCompositionAsModel and createComponentAsModel.
 
If you have a default value for defineModel prop and you don't provide any value for this prop from the parent component, it can cause a de-synchronization between parent and child components. In the example below, the parent's myRef is undefined, but the child's model is 1:
 
Another way of implementing v-model within this component is to use a writable computed property with both a getter and a setter. The get method should return the modelValue property and the set method should emit the corresponding event:
 
When we were learning about form input bindings, we saw that v-model has built-in modifiers - .trim, .number and .lazy. In so
