In this guide, the installation process for GFortran on Windows, Linux, macOS and OpenBSD is presented in a beginner-friendly format based on the information from GFortranBinaries.

**Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):** An official compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables on Windows. With Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI one can run text editors and other graphical programs.
 
Finally, you can switch between different versions or set the default one with the **update-alternatives** (see manpage). There are many online tutorials on how to use this feature. A well structured one using as an example C and C++ can be found here, you can apply the same logic by replacing either gcc or g++ with gfortran.
 
OpenCoarrays is an open-source software project that produces an application binary interface (ABI) used by the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Fortran front-end to build executable programs that leverage the parallel programming features of Fortran 2018. Since OpenCoarrays is not a separate compiler, we include it here, under gfortran.
 
While with gfortran you can compile perfectly valid code using coarrays, the generated binaries will only run in a single image (image is a Fortran term for a parallel process), that is, in serial mode. OpenCoarrays allows running code in parallel on shared- and distributed-memory machines, similar to MPI:

There is also a separate distribution of mingw-w64 that can be installed without MSYS2, but I don't recommend it, as the last files there have gcc-8.1.0, from 2018 (apart from a recent build by Ray Linn that includes the Ada, but not the Fortran compiler).
 
Another compiler that is now free is Intel Fortran : you have to install Microsoft Visual Studio Community, Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit and Intel oneAPI HPC Toolkit. More information here. Available on Linux, macOS and Windows (of course, Visual Studio is needed only on Windows). Intel oneAPI is at least partly open source, not sure about the Fortran compiler.
 
MSYS2 is a much smaller package (in terms of disk pace needed), and is used by several other free projects: R (Rtools), Octave and Strawberry Perl all include parts of it, including the gcc compilers.
 
To compile Fortran code for Windows you need a Fortran compiler for Windows. Microsoft neither provides a built-in one nor offers one for sale. Third-party compilers are available, including gfortran, but you'll need to install one yourself. If you want to use gfortran in particular, or if you like it simply because you don't have to spend money to get it, then I would recommend obtaining it as part of mingw-w64. Alternatives are available from multiple vendors, some free of charge, but most for sale.
 
Fortran is one of the earliest imperative computer programming languages around. It is often used for scientificand numeric programs. This page lists free Fortran compilers for various operating systems. Note that the differentsoftware listed are compliant with different Fortran standards, eg, ANSI Fortran 77, Fortran 95, Fortran 2003,Fortran 2008, Fortran 2018, and so on, so be sure to get the appropriate one for your purpose. Some of them may alsocome complete with debuggers,editors and anintegrated development environment (IDE).
 
The MinGW-w64 project provides the libraries, headers and runtime needed for the GNU compilers, among whichis their Fortran compiler, to run on a Windows system. They allow you to create both32 bit and 64 bit programs with the compilers. The project also provides cross compilers, so that you cancompile (say) a Windows program from a Linux system if you choose. Precompiled binaries can be obtained froma variety of sources, includingthe official MinGW-w64 binaries site,and third-party sites such as the MSYS2 project.
 
Flang is the Fortran compiler front end of the LLVM project (which also includes other compilers, suchas a C/C++ compiler).The current version (as at the date this was written) implements Fortran 2003 (with some features fromFortran 2008), while the next version (currently foundhere) implements Fortran 2018.The link above leads to the source code for the compiler. Thedownloadable binaries (ie, executables)can be found here. Note that the binaries are for Linux (both x86-64 and OpenPOWER) only, although work ona Windows port has begun.
 
Silverfrost FTN95 is a Fortran 95 compiler that supports Fortran 77, Fortran 90 and Fortran 95. The compiler generates32-bit and 64-bit exectuables for Windows and the Microsoft .NET framework. It comes with CHECKMATE,a tool that lets programmers check the correctness of their code at runtime. Also included is Plato 3 (an IDE),full source level debugging, documentation and examples. You may only generate code for your personal use on yourhome computer, and all executables will display a banner on execution.
 
The Oracle Developer Studio includes C, C++ and Fortran compilers for Linux (specifically the Red Hat and Oracledistributions) andSolaris. Based on information displayed on the download page at the date this entry was written, it looks like you canfreely use the compiler for developing commercial applications if you wish. (As with all software, you should of courseverify this yourself, since the situation sometimes changes over time.)
 
gfortran, part of the GNU Compiler Collection, is a free Fortran 95/2003/2008 compiler. Like all things from GNU,it comes primarily in source code form. Precompiled binaries (executables) are available for Windows from third-partysites (such as those listed on this page), and if you run Linux, you can probably just get it from your distribution'srepositories.
 
This is a well-known Fortran to C converter that comes with source code. The site alsoincludes pre-compiled binaries (executables) for MSDOS and Microsoft Windows, althoughthese are by no means the only systems supported; the compiler works on Unix systems likeBSD, Linux, etc, though you have to compile it yourself on those systems.Libraries containing the runtime support needed (together with the C source code)are also included. You need a C compiler to generatebinaries from your Fortran sources.
 
[**Update**: this website appears to be gone. For the record, it was previously located atwww.g95.org.]G95 is an open source Fortran 95 compiler. At the time this was written, most of the ISO Fortran 95 standardhas been implemented. Platforms supported include Linux(x86, Intel IA64, AMD x86\_64), Windows, Macintosh OS X, FreeBSD,Sparc Solaris and HP-UX.
 
**Windows XP / Windows 7 Instructions**
Below are instructions to install a free minimal FORTRAN compilationenvironment for Microsoft Windows users. There are two free products to install, the compiler itself (mingw) and a graphical front-end (Code::Blocks). 1. Download mingw from here: -get-inst/ 2. Double click on the installation file. It is recommended that you not change the default install location, which is c:\mingw.
During the installation be sure to select the Fortran Compiler in the component selection window as shown in the image below. 3. Download Code::Blocks for Fortran for Windows 32bit from this link: 
 4. Note that this version of Code::Blocks for Fortran does not require an actual installation. Simply unzip the downloaded package, then run the codeblocks.exe file directly from the resulting folder. You will be presented with the following options. Please check the option as shown in the image below. 5. To create a new fortran program click on file>New>File>Select Fortran Source>Hit Go and follow the instructions in the dialog box. 6. To open an existing fortran source file select File>Open> and navigate to the fortran source file. 
 
 **Mac OSX Instructions**
Below is the link to the instructions to download and install GCC 4.7,4.8 compiler suite. This compiler can be invoked using the OSX Terminal program. Note that the GCC 4.7,4.8 suite contains the required gfortran compiler. It can be downloaded by clicking on the link located just underneath the Computaion Tools :: C/Fortran section of the page.

The most convenient way to do the exercises is on your own computer after installing acompiler. The main choices are listedbelow. **gfortran** is the mostuniversal/popular, is completely free and can be usedon Windows, MacOSX or Linux. The**Intel** compiler is probably the bestcompiler, is available free to individuals, and also works on Windows, MacOSX and Linux.
 
**gfortran**: Developed by the GNU,the free software foundation. See

- Linux: One of the optional packages to install.
- MacOSX: Install (i) Xcode (from App Store), (ii) XCode command line tools, (iii) gfortran from A good guide to this process is here.
- Windows: There are 3 main possibilities: (i) Install MinGW, which allows you to use gfortraninside a Command Prompt window. Follow these instructions, being sure to edit your path. (ii) Install Cygwin, which provides a unix-likeenvironment in which you can use gfortran(www.cygwin.com - make sure to select fortran duringthe installation process; your files can be found inC:\cygwin64\home\yourname). (iii) Install Microsoft's Windows Subsystem forLinux (WSL), which allows you to run a full Linuxinstallation at the same time as Windows, as discussedhere and here.

    A good editor that highlights Fortran syntax is also veryuseful. Emacs is a good one: for Mac the Aquamacsversion is nice, for Windows download the emacs-w64version. Another suitable one for Windows is Kate.
