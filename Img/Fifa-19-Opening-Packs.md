FIFA fans are buzzing with excitement and strategizing fiercely over the best time to crack open those precious packs. The stakes are high, and the choices are many. From stocking up on fodder to awaiting the perfect moment, passions are running high in the FIFA subreddit.
 
The dilemma between saving packs for potentially higher rewards during specific TOTS events or opening them promptly for immediate team improvements is a hot topic among FIFA fans. Some advocate for patience and strategic planning, while others prefer instant gratification, eager to enhance their squads without delay.

With league-specific TOTS releases on the horizon, fans are torn between saving packs for these highly anticipated events or using them to bolster their teams immediately. Each choice carries its own set of risks and rewards, adding an extra layer of complexity to the pack-opening debate.
 
**In an important decision for the gaming world, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State decided on 9 March 2022 that loot boxes do not automatically qualify as of games of chance. The Division also set out clear steps to be followed when assessing loot boxes under gambling legislation.**
 
Because the packs do not constitute a stand-alone game, but are part of a game of skill, they are not a game of chance and do not require a license. Therefore, EA did not violate the Betting and Gaming Act and the KSA should not have imposed a sanction.
 
The KSA took the position that loot boxes, in which chance determines the content and the prizes have an economic value, must be considered a game of chance in the sense of the Betting and Gaming Act (Wet op de kansspelen, or Wok) (Act) and that a prohibition applies to them.
 
According to the KSA, this applied to the packs in FIFA, which have an economic value because the contents can be traded on the virtual transfer market. Because EA did not have a license to offer games of chance, it was in violation of the prohibition laid down in the Act.
 
EA lodged an appeal with the Division against the district court decision, arguing that the packs and the FUT mode are not a game of chance within the meaning of the Act. According to EA, the packs are part of a broader game of skill (the FUT Mode) and, although adding an element of chance, do not constitute a separate game. Most packs can only be acquired through playing the game. Another portion of packs can be opened by paying money; a gamer can theoretically only open those packs separately from FIFA matches. Furthermore, the contents of the packs do not qualify as prizes or premiums, they cannot be legally converted into money and are closed off from the economy.
 
The Division noted that it was not in dispute that the game FIFA and specifically its FUT mode is a game of skill. FUT mode is a game in which gamers play virtual soccer matches. Playing these matches is the goal of the game and to do this as well as possible, gamers must try to put together a strong team that suits their style of play. They can do this by opening packs or by buying players on the transfer market with FUT coins. These FUT coins can only be earned by playing the game. Thus, the packs are a part of the FUT mode and add an element of chance to it.
 
The packs can be obtained in a number of ways. The largest percentage is obtained through in-game involvement. A smaller proportion of packs are purchased by FIFA players using FUT coins. Only a small portion of packs are obtained with FIFA points. These points represent a virtual currency that FIFA players can obtain by purchasing with real money, or through donations from EA or other gaming platforms. The packs and transfer market are an integral and integrated part of the FUT mode. To play the soccer matches, it is furthermore important that the FIFA player deploys various skills, such as in a general sense dexterous playing of computer games, understanding (virtual) soccer on a tactical level and managing a soccer team, play formations and soccer players. Managing the team should also be aimed at creating a certain synergy between the virtual soccer players. All this requires insight, knowledge, experience, and dexterity when playing the games. Skill is a decisive part of the game.
 
The Division continued that it cannot be said in general that the loot box phenomenon leads to a stand-alone game being offered within a game. If the price determination is determined by chance and the prize won represents a certain economic value, it cannot be excluded that by the introduction of loot boxes a game of chance within the meaning of the Act is created. However, before being able to assess whether a game of chance has been created by the packs in FIFA, it must first be assessed whether the obtaining or opening of the packs can be regarded as a stand-alone game.
 
In view of the above, the Division concluded that the KSA wrongly took the position that the acquisition and opening of the packs could be regarded as a stand-alone game, and to that extent it could not be regarded as a game of chance in the sense of the Act. The KSA did not argue that the game FIFA as a whole was a game of chance. This meant that the KSA decision could not be upheld.
 
FIFA Ultimate Team displays pack probabilities\*, which details the likelihood of receiving player items of a certain type and minimum rating in every pack. We believe that providing you with this information will help you make decisions on where you want to invest your FIFA Points, FUT Coins, and time in order to build your best FUT squad.
 
Pack probabilities in FIFA are calculated by simulating the opening of a very large number of each pack type in the FUT Store. The number of packs opened in a simulation varies based on the content within those packs, but it will always be enough to be statistically valid. We then re-run this process with every content update.
 
Any probability percentages that you see are on a pack-by-pack basis and are not cumulative. That means that each pack opening is an independent event; opening multiple packs does not change the likelihood of being awarded an item from a specific category. If you flip a coin three times and get heads each time, you still have a 50% chance of getting heads if you flip the coin again.
 
Live content and new items are added to FUT for the current title on a regular basis, which could change the probability numbers throughout the season. Probabilities are accurate as of the timestamp indicated at the bottom of that screen.
 
FIFA Ultimate Team is a live service that we are always looking to improve. This means being open to player feedback at all times. We know all the effort you put into building up your squad, and we want that time to be as rewarding and fun as possible.
 
Many people spend a lot of their hard-earned cash on FIFA Ultimate Team packs every year and starting with FIFA 19, EA Sports is disclosing the odds of getting a highly-rated player in each pack. This is to make it more transparent when buying points on the store to purchase packs and highlights just how rare (or common) some players are in FIFA 19.
 
Packs can be bought in the FIFA Ultimate Team store using in-game coins or FIFA Points, and range from Bronze Packs to Gold Packs as well as limited time and often limited availability Promo Packs. Bronze Packs are the cheapest to buy, but also offer the lowest-value rewards - usually around three bronze players and then various consumable and club items. Promo Packs are the most expensive but are the best chance of getting elite players.
 
Often, during special promotions such as Ultimate Scream for Halloween and FUTmas, EA Sports release limited availability packs on the store which are sold to the first X amount of buyers and then disappear from the market. Other Promo Packs are available for a specified time period such as 24 or 48 hours but are limited to 5 or 10 per person.
 
Bronze, Silver and Gold Packs are always available, but sometimes it's worth checking these categories on the Store as there are often Jumbo versions of the Premium Packs available that provide an extra rare card - and thus an increased chance of opening a high-rated player.
 
The most valuable items in FIFA Ultimate Team are rare gold players, which have not only the best quick sell value, but also the highest price on the transfer market. Usually, the higher rating a player has, the higher their price will be (there are notable exceptions like big names playing in smaller leagues like Andres Iniesta).
 
The Promo Packs offer the best chance of getting the best players, but these are not always available in the Store. They tend to be available at the weekends and especially during events or holidays e.g. Christmas, St Patrick's Day or when Team of the Year or Team of the Season is announced and in packs.
 
The Jumbo Rare Players Pack and Ultimate Pack are the most sought-after - and most expensive - packs every year. They cost over 100k coins each (or 2000+ points) but contain only rare gold players and thus have a much higher probability of getting an elite player like Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi.
 
FIFA Ultimate Team packs can be bought on the co
