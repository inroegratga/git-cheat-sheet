Drugflash causes malfunction in sensory organs covering view in static noise. Also every few seconds, the effect causes change the current direction of walking/running to random, making it difficult to move properly. Sensor obscure and walking interference gets stronger the stronger flash is. Effect dissipates over time, but you can get rid of it immediately just by using another drug. This makes a neverending cycle that can make you crippled for several minutes just to reset the flash and walk properly.

Start of drugflash effect is indicated when a bar under Intoxicated buff starts to disappear.
