I have tried to register my router with Netgear but the website gives an error and says to contact support. When I follow the link and click on the "Contact Support" button my page goes blank. I'm stuck in a loop and want to register the router so I can access it's settings - it says it's already registered but it's a brand new product.
 
You can also register your device on MyNETGEAR page (my.netgear.com). Please click this link as your reference. If it still says "Device is registered", please message me the serial number of the device.
 
My dad passed away & I'm setting up his router on my network. I would like to add it to my account but he already registered. Do I need to add it so I can additionally control with my mobile? I will be using my existing x4s (2600) as a repeater.

I just read this post; Is this still an active post? I am experiencing similar issues to that of Bullet. I can access my actual router via routerlogin.net but when I attempt to register for an account with NETGEAR I receive the response "serial number already exists." I read and followed your instructions to Bullet but same results. Do I need to provide you with my serial number? Any and all assistance is greatly appreciated.
 
I was able to rectify my registration issues. It would appear by creating a profile here within the NETGEAR COMMUNITY has granted me access to NETGEAR's site via the "MYNETGEAR" address you provided to another user experiencing a similar problem. So my situation has been resolved and I merely wanted to notify you of this change. But maybe this post will help out some users down the road.
 
Would you be able to add my new product to my account? I can only see my last router that stopped working a few weeks ago for no reason. I bought a new one and tried to register my New Router but it says 'unable to register product - already registered.'
 
I bought the Archer A7 Router back in June and then bought the RE300 Extender. I cannot register either product. I have been through customer support and they didn't help. It is for the US version. I can enter the Serial number but then it says it cannot find the serial number. After i received the Extender, it worked for 1 day and then doesn't work at all anymore. Customer support helped me try to resolve the issue but the final conclusion was they told me that I needed a new one. So I can't get a new one because I can't register my products on their site. I have been emailing with their customer support for about 3 weeks now and have even sent them my proof of purchase, a video of what the extender was doing as well as pictures, and I have also sent them pictures of the serial numbers for both products. They did say the problem should be fixed but it wasn't and I still can't register my products. I also sent them a picture of how it says it cannot find the serial number. I was about done and finally decided to return the extender back to Amazon where I purchased it. I would love to be able to register my Archer A7 Router so if something happens to it in the next 2 years I can use the warranty. Resolving the issue would also be appreciated in a timely manner as well.
 
What you need to do is to contact support so they can ensure your serial number is added to the database so you can then register it. First they will verify your device and warranty, then help with the rest.
 
@Gingerbytes yes i was able to get this fixed. When i wrote the review someone contacted me and said if it wasn't resolved in 24 hours to contact them. it was resolved later that day. I tried Customer service and was on the phone with them for about an hour and they didn't help at all. here is the person that helped me get my devices registered, zoe.ma@tp-link.com. They really need to fix this problem. Good luck!

105 of Part VI of Title 51 of the Louisiana Administrative Code requires that all food, drug, and cosmetic products sold in packaged form within the state of Louisiana be registered with the Food and Drug Unit.
 
A Certificate of Registration is distinct and separate from a Permit to Operate. All facilities that fall under the auspices of Part VI, Part X, Part XXVIII, or other Food and Drug regulations must be permitted. Only those facilities which produce a retail-packaged food, drug, or cosmetic commodity are required to register such commodities with FDU. See the FAQ section below for detailed information on this topic.
 
The term "standard" applies to the registration of any products that are not classified as "out-of-state soft drinks." By "out-of-state," we mean that the **responsible party declaration** includes an address that is not within the state of Louisiana. These products require a different form and are assessed a fee according to a different schedule from other food, drug, cosmetic, and prophylactic products. More information on these registrations can be found below.
 
Most responsible parties for in-state (Louisiana-manufactured/distributed) items will require a Permit to Operate from the department for their warehouse or manufacturing facility. The only exceptions are those copacked (private-label) products that are distributed by the **copacker** or that are taken directly from the copacker's premises to the retailers that will be marketing them. For products whose distributor or manufacturer requires a permit, the first point-of-contact should be the sanitarian who covers the area where the permitted facility will be located. This information can be found here. The responsible party should provide copies of labelling or label proofs to the relevant sanitarian for a preliminary review. At his or her option the sanitarian may then forward the labels/proofs to the registration progam manager for a final review. When the labels have been assessed and accepted for registration, the sanitarian will notify the responsible party, who may prepare a registration packet to be provided at the time of permitting of the facility.
 
For products that do not require a Permit to Operate and out-of-state non-soft-drink items, the labels or proofs may be sent directly to the program manager for product registration for review. The program manager will notify the responsible party of any necessary revisions and when the labels are accepted for registration, the responsible party may forward a registration packet to the Central Office for processing.
 
Registration packets include the following items: a completed copy of the FD-9(N) Application for a New Product Registration Form, a list of the products being registered, copies of labelling or label proofs, samples for foods (see below), and a check or money order payable to LDH for the amount of the registration fee.
 
Effective August 1, 2015, the Food and Drug Unit of the Office of Public Health no longer registers alcoholic beverage products. Act 393 of the 2015 Louisiana Legislature transferred this authority to the Office of Alcohol and Tobacco Control of the Louisiana Department of Revenue.
 
Please do not send registration packets for new alcoholic beverages to this office. If you need to register a new alcoholic beverage for distribution in the state of Louisiana, please contact the Office of Alcohol and Tobacco Control at 225-925-4041 or -product-labeling/.
 
Please also be aware that this statutory change does NOT affect the requirement for in-state alcohol producers or distributors to hold a Permit to Operate with this office. If you need information about how to open a new brewery, winery, or alcohol warehouse in Louisiana, please contact your Food and Drug Unit sanitarian.
 
Registration packets for out-of-state soft drinks include the following items: a completed copy of the FD-35 Application for a New Out-of-State Soft Drink Registration form, a list of products to be registered, specimen copies of labelling, samples (see below), and a check or money order payable to LDH for the registration fee.
