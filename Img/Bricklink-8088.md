Built with the latest in Republic technology, this Clone Wars fighter-bomber carries a crew of clone pilots and Jedi Master Kit Fisto into battle anywhere the enemy strikes. Turn the gear on the back to open and close the S-foil attack wings, then push it to launch auto-firing flick missiles!

Interesting, the picture is in a similar orientation as the old box art for the 7259. In this box, you get all new figures when compared to the old 7259. I like the planet background. Being the old version was bomber, this would make sense. This new one is a Starfighter so a fighting background would be better but would clutter it up a bit too much.
 
Back of the box. Shows what the ARC-170 can do. Like the cockpit opening up. How to open the wings by turning the gear in the back of the ship. And how to fire the two missiles located under the ship. You would "hit" the gear on the back of the ship, which would hit the back of the missiles to launch them. The older 7259 dropped bombs when you pulled the gear on the back of the ship.

Each window has a sticker. And so does the center cockpit side panels. That's the stickers on the upper right of this photo. **Look carefully, it's a picture of a mini-fig hands over a control panel**. The older 7259 didn't use a sticker on a solid color part, they used a clear Lego piece with a clear sticker with lines. So you could see inside the middle cockpit. **Note:** Be careful with clear stickers! Once you put them on, the glue comes off and stays on the Lego piece. And it'll get real UGLY fast!
 
Front shot. Kit-Fisto, Captain Jag and a clone pilot. The R4-P44 droid absent from picture due to maintenance. Kit's face is bad. It's all rubber so it's molded well but ugly. I like Captain Jag's helmet. Very nice detail.
 
Rear shot. Kit-Fisto, Captain Jag (helmet removed) and a clone pilot. As you can see, while with the helmet on, the orange stripe on the minifigs head looks great for a visor, without the helmet, his head looks like a cruel joke where someone put suntan lotion on his head.
 
Same thing as the back of the box. And yes, the missiles are fixed straight. But unless you hit the "gear" on the back hard, it'll come out at a sloping angle and miss the nose of the ship. I guess they wanted to keep in line with the SW:Clone Wars where these are not bombers, but Starfighters.
 
And here is the finished body. And yes, I put the center-side stickers on back wards! Since its a clear sticker, if I pull it off, it'll be ruined. Maybe nobody will notice the hands are upside down? :)
 
Here is a view of the engine mounted on one side and opposite view of the unmounted engine. If you click on the picture, you can see the blue rubber band that allows the folding wings to open and close.
 
I hope you like this shot. It came out better than I thought. The left side is the 8088 and the right is the older 7259. While looking so much a like, many things are changed. The nose of the old looks more Lego-ish. But looks like what you saw in the movie. The 8088 nose is closer to the clone wars series on TV. The engine is bigger on the new 8088, but while it looks like a engine, you can tell it's a wheel rim. The 7259 looks like a jet engine intake. What it intakes in space is beyond me. The green color on the nose is longer on the 7259 and continues under the cockpit. The wings are made differently and as you'll find out shortly, the gear to fold the wings is done different as well.
 
Top view of the cockpit. 8088 on top and 7259 on the bottom. The computers on the 7259 is painted. 8088 is stickers. The rear nacelles next to the rear gun is painted on the 7259 and it's done very well. The 8088 is just a small single sticker. The 7259 center area is actually hinged to open as you can see in the picture. I like that. Also the 7259 set used smoked clear plastic for the center sides, unlike the 8088 which used a sticker to "simulate" a porthole. I guess the plus on that one, is the "white" that the 7259 sticker used for that smoked plastic, you can really tell that was a sticker. You'll also notice the 7259 doesn't use stickers on the cockpit canopy. From the top view like this, the engines looks more thought out on the 8088. The 7259 looks like they were just trying to figure out how to add an engine and a way to fold the wings on it. If I remember right, you load the bombs under the R5-D4 droid in the 7259. Notice the front canopy on the 7259 doesn't have a hinge on it. You just pull it off.
 
And finally here is a closeup view of the gearing for the folding wings. The 8088 on the left and 7259 on the right. Lego used a rotating ball for the first. Nice idea. The use of the white rubber band blended well. On the 8088, they went technic on use. I with the yellow stud they used was grey. Would've matched better. They also used a blue rubber band. Not sure why they made it loop around a wider area, except to maybe have less flexing of the wing.
 
Overall I LOVE this set. I like most Star Wars Lego sets. It looks like what it's supposed to be, but what I don't like is when they previously released a set and they didn't improve on it by much. It is cleaner and more up to date, but as you read in the comparison of the old set, many things was done right the first time. Maybe if I can force myself to dismantle both sets, I'll make one set with the good of both sets.
 
**Design:**3/5 Right in the middle. Design is close. But many things that was good on the old set, they didn't use on this set. Like when they used printed pieces on the 7259 or a clear window instead of a fake sticker to look like a window.
 
**Build experience:**3/5 It's made for ages 8+. My son can build this. But the stickers are a royal pain because this set uses a lot of clear stickers, and clear stickers are harder to remove without damaging the clear area of the sticker.
 
Indeed I enjoyed reading it. Especially nice is the consequent comparison with the older set. The merged images with one half being the old, and the other half being the new model are great and quickly provide an overview over the two sets for everyone.
 
I know my son wants Cad Bane. I have a feeling the set is gonna be average but cost more. I think LEGO is catching on that people buy and sell the minifigs so they raise the price of sets with unique minis. I remember how much the set with Yoda cost or the one with Mace Windu (working lightsaber) cost. Ok, well that set was large.
 
On my previous model, because the rubber band is on one side the wings lean towards the rubber band side. Maybe having the rubberband on bot sides of the wing solves this issue. That or they didn't feel like including those black ball-pins anymore.
 
I loved the comparison pictures they really showed us what was improved because a lot of people had a hard time seeing that (**Legoman** ). I really love this set I think it is the second best set just under Luke's Landspeeder.
 
This is a FANTASTIC review. I enjoyed reading it very very much. I have put of this set for awhile, mostly cause of the price. And even after such a great review I'm still not sure about it The comparison with the old ARC was perfect, i really needed to see something like that, i appreciate the time and effort gone into this review.
 
Awesome review as always, starstreak. Your pictures are so high-quality it's almost unbelievable, and your Photoshopping is flawless. The comparison shots are great, and really show how much better the newer version is.
 
I like the set itself quite a bit, but it seems a tad expensive for the parts, and I want to spend a little less this year. However, the minifigs are great and the set is very sleek. I think I can resist, but at least the decision will be easier with informative reviews like yours.
 
Thanks to all for the comments on my review. I'm glad the pictures came out well. White on White background is never easy. But I didn't have another color to use. :) Not to mention, the wingspan on this is large. Made it hard to photograph on my normal table. lol.
 
I own the original and can see there's loads of improvements to the shape and detail in this new set. I've been resisting the temptation to buy it thinking it too similar to the old set while being 20 more expensive - and the parts count is virtually the same too. However these pictures whet my appetite! I think there's enough difference in there to warrant a purchase, just maybe not at full price.
 
I just got this set, the body is one stud wider than the original, as are the wings, so this set is bigger than the original one by one stud either side. The engines are obviously bigger, yet shorter, the structure of the wings is different, but not much. All in all an improvement on the original, though I do miss the sides opening up like the old one, the droid also sat higher, in this one, the head just peers above the cockpit.
