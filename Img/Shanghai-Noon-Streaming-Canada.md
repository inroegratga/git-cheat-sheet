A week ago, De Grasse ran 10.15 seconds in the 100 at the Drake Relays in his first race since being forced to withdraw from the world track and field championships last August with a strained right hamstring.
 
"In the 200 metres, Andre has the innate ability to maintain his top-end speed, so I think this is a great call by his coach [Stuart McMillan] and team to put him in the 200 this early," said Bailey, the 1996 Olympic 100 champion. "Not only will this help him get rid of more race rust, it will also help him work on his acceleration into the curve, off the curve and with his acceleration [on the straightaway] which will help in the 100 later [this season]."
 
Bailey said race rust was evident in the first 30 metres of De Grasse's performance last week in Des Moines, Iowa, where he finished fourth behind winner Isiah Young (10.02) fellow American Mike Rodgers (10.03) and C.J. Ujah (10.13) of Great Britain.
 
More importantly, the 23-year-old De Grasse came out of the event healthy following the first serious injury of his track career. Bailey, who suffered a variety of injuries during his illustrious career, said the Markham, Ont., runner would now feel a sense of ease and freedom to extend and challenge himself in training.
 
"I know he and [McMillan] were working on Andre's ability to get out of the [starting] blocks and transition," said Bailey. "One of the things Andre was doing [last season] was relying on his top-end speed. But because the playing field is so level [with eight-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt now retired] he has to take advantage of getting out of the blocks consistently."

De Grasse will face a star-studded field in Doha that is minus reigning world 100 champion Justin Gatlin, 2017 world silver medallist Christian Coleman and Ronnie Baker, who won bronze in the 60m at the world indoor championships in March.
 
Leading the way is reigning world 200 champion Ramil Guliyev of Turkey, 2017 Diamond League champion Noah Lyles of the United States and world bronze medallist Jereem Richards of Trinidad and Tobago, who is making his Diamond League debut after prevailing in the 200 at the Commonwealth Games last month in 20.12.
 
Lyles has won both of his Diamond League races, running a world-leading 19.90 as a 19-year-old last May in Shanghai, China, and returning from injury to capture the circuit's final event in Brussels on Sept. 10.
 
Brown, 25, clocked 20.34 in his season-opening 200 at the Commonwealth Games after running the fastest semifinal in Games history (20.18). The Toronto native crossed the line third but was upgraded to second and a silver medal when England's Zharnel Hughes was disqualified for clipping the arm of Richards.
 
Brown ran 20.13 in the 200 final last July at the Canadian championships and finished a trying 2017 campaign with a 20.17 effort in Brussels. At worlds in August, he turned in a season-best 20.08 in his 200 heat race but was disqualified for a lane violation. A month earlier, Brown was booted from the 100 final at the Canadian championships for a false start.
 
"I feel in great shape and in pretty good health. In sprinting, you're rarely ever 100 per cent," said Brown, who spent the early part of last season recovering from a left quadriceps muscle strain that didn't heal until June. "I knew once I got healthy [last season] I'd be able to perform at a high level.
 
"This is a tremendous field [in Doha] and I want to earn respect by competing against some of the best the world has to offer. Heading towards 2020 [and the Tokyo Olympics] I want to be seen as a contender and this is a good opportunity to gain some momentum and confidence."
 
Added Bailey: "I sense a different Aaron this year, that he has a plan to improve. He's no longer afraid to compete and when he gets to the final [of a race] he has no fear running his own race, staying relaxed and running smoothly. I'm very happy that mentally, he's finally [arrived] and can put it together in the big race."
 
Caster Semenya, the newly crowned Commonwealth champion in the 800 and 1,500, will compete in the latter event on Friday (12:13 p.m. ET) for the first time since the International Association of Athletics Federations announced the introduction of new regulations limiting the levels of natural testosterone allowed in the bodies of female athletes competing at distances from 400 to 1,500 metres.

The ship was asleep and did not hear him. He lowered his big canvasthirty-year bag to the ground and stood there in the moon shadow of abrick wall and had his long first look at her. She looked stubby andblocky and topheavy down there at the edge of the black, rolling river,and she was all moon-white except for her slender black smokestack thatrose very high, high as her two masts. Four guy wires slanted down fromthe stack like streamers from a maypole. She had a stubby, shielded gunon her open bow and a doubled, man-high hand steering wheel on her openfantail aft, but in between she looked more like a house than a ship.Her square, curtained windows and screened doors opened on a galleriedmain deck like a long, narrow veranda and on a pipe-railed boat deckunder taut white awnings. It was after midnight and they were asleepdown there, all but the watch. In a few minutes he'd go aboard and finda bunk and wake up with them in the morning like a strange bird in theirnest.
 
Jake Holman knew he was a strange bird and he was used to going aboardnew ships. By the time they realized they were in a struggle Jake Holmanwould already have made for himself the place he wanted on their shipand they could never dislodge him. Or wish to. It was going to be thesame on the U.S.S. *San Pablo*. He did not know why he was reluctant togo right aboard. This one might be a pretty strange nest, too, hethought.
 
Since he had gotten his orders a month ago in Manila he had not beenable to find anyone who had ever seen the ship or who had even beenshipmates with an ex-*San Pablo* sailor. Nobody knew any more about herthan Holman already knew himself, after six years on the China Station,and that was more legend than fact. She was one of the ancient gunboatscaptured from Spain and sent to form the Yangtze Patrol during the BoxerRebellion, in the year Jake Holman was born. They were all relics now,in June of 1925, and a flotilla of modern gunboats was building inShanghai to replace them. The others sometimes appeared in Shanghai, butthe *San Pablo* never came further downriver than Hankow. They said shewas least and ugliest of Comyang's gunboats and he was ashamed to showthe flag on the likes of her down around the glitter of Shanghai. Shedid not even operate on the Yangtze, but on some nameless tributariesfrom the south, and on a big lake that was said to expand and contractmysteriously and to have mermaids in it. From the legends, the *SanPablo* spent half her time high and dry on sandbars in the namelessrivers with the crew ashore cultivating gardens and slaughtering theirown beef and mining their own coal, while the natives took pot shots atthem.
 
Holman did not believe the legends, but he thought she was still afunny-looking ship. A lighted quarterdeck was inset amidships on themain deck with a short gangplank leading up from the pontoon through agap in the solid steel bulwark. Two men stood on watch there beside apulpitlike log desk, one in regulation undress whites and the other inthe white shorts and short-sleeved sport shirt that was summer uniformfor Yangtze Patrol sailors. At least two more in shorts were patrollingwith rifles on the shadowy boat deck. That was a lot of men for thetopside watch on a quiet midnight, Holman thought.
 
He was a sandy-haired, squarely built, powerful man in dress whites andhe stood there in the moon shadow thinking and nuzzling his chin with afat brown envelope. The envelope held his records and pay accounts andit was wound with red tape sealed in four places with blobs of red waxso that Jake Holman could not examine or tamper with the Navy's littlepaper image of himself. Paper Jake Holman, he sometimes called it in histhoughts. When he turned Paper Jake in down on that quarterdeck, hewould be aboard officially on paper. He would be in the thick of itagain.
 
Well, *go on down*, he told himself, but he did not go. He sniffed thecool, damp breeze off the river and listened to the lapping, rustlingmurmur of the moving water and he heard the steady plashing sound of acooling water overboard discharge. He could not see it along the ship'ssteel side. Must be on the port side, he thought. It's late, he thought,and the first few days are always rough ones. *Go aboard*, you stupidbastard, and get some sleep. He picked up the thirty-year bag andstarted down the plank walkway to the flat steel pontoon.
 
The man in regulation whites ran out on the pontoon to take Holman'sseabag. He was Chinese. Holman stepped aboard and saluted aft, accordingto regulation. The man in shorts returned the salute, which was notregulation, because he was an enlisted man in a white hat.
 
The man was tall and skinny and heavily tattooed on arms and legs and hehad a drooping brown mustache. He wore a holstered pistol. Holman noddedand handed him the brown envelope. The man glanced at the seals andlifted the hinged top of the log desk, like a gaping mouth, dropped inthe en
