This is relatively straightforward. It's basically just deleting all the faces at once. In the screencast below, I first use "Find Features" to identify the fillet (just to make deleting it easier, you don't have to do it this way). Then, I just selected the remaining faces of the cutout, and used "Delete" to get rid of them. In Fusion, in the Model workspace, deleting a face will "heal" the body:
 
Hey Jeff,
I have a few more revisions that would really help me out.I don't want to take advantage of your time, but Can I send you some stuff and you send me the file back?
thanks

no!! This is awesome work man. If you know of any good online classes I would appreciate it. But check this out. So, I want to change the name of the product from BōT RōP to MOOR LINE with this font. How do you delete BōT RōP and Put moor Line like the font you see in the attachment?
thanks
 
Hmm... It should work. You might try a different font, just for that one character. Although I tried two, and found the same problem (it took me a while to get that character even added to the text). This looks like a bug, and I'll report it. In the meantime, yes, I guess the workaround is to add a small R and a circle...
 
I think there is another Glitch in the matrix. I want to use the font serpentine bold and I found the text in the text box pull down menu but it turns out to be a different text in fusion. Here is what it should look like and here is what fusion is putting out. Fusion's serpentine bold is in the blue. The other attachment is what it should look like.
 
One thing to realize is this. If there isn't a sketch currently active (in edit mode), then selecting ANY of the sketch commands will actual run 2 commands. It runs "create new sketch" first. The first click in this situation will actually serve to select the plane you want to start that new sketch on. I suspect your picking one of the origin plans by accident here because your not starting with an active sketch.
 
I did it! Man this program is so technical...It took me awhile because I wasn't selecting the text before I extruded and then I didn't select the object before extruding. I'm new to the program and I am learning on the fly. if you have any classes I can take let me know.
 
To fix that depends on how you created the sheet metal flange. if you came off of a drawing line you could go back and edit the drawing and that should fix it, if your not in sheet metal then create a construction Plane in the center, split the body then push pull an equal amount of both halves then push together and combine. can you post your model if your having issues.
 
Hey Jason,
you can't do a little video of that can you? I'm looking to get all holes at 12.7 mm which is half an inch. The bend with the hole is seeming to do things funky as well?? Sorry for the inconvenience.
