Aventon is a manufacturer of electric bikes based in Ontario, CA. The company performs every component of manufacturing in-house. This includes welding, painting, polishing, and more. Founded in 2012 by JW Zhang, Aventon started as a fixed gear bicycle company. In 2018, the company released its first electric bike, the Pace 500. By 2020, the company had discontinued its fixed gear bikes to focus solely on e-bikes. It also moved from its original Los Angeles-based warehouse to Ontario this same year. Today, Aventon are among the best electric bikes in the market, and the company has sold over 300,000 models. We named the Aventon Soltera the best budget electric bike you can buy. On this page, we're listing today's best Aventon discount codes along with other ways to save on your e-bike purchase.
 
Cargo bikes are becoming more popular in the ebike (and regular bike) markets for obvious - and not so -obvious - reasons. Obvious: They can haul a lot of stuff, including kiddos, cargo and sometimes pets, often all at the same time, and with a motor added on, their range and flexibility is greatly extended. Not so obvious: If you can do all those things with a bicycle, your very-expensive-to-operate automobile will sit much more than it already does, meaning your fuel bill, maintenance needs and possibly per-mile insurance costs will go down as well.
 
Aventon did their homework before introducing the Abound, and it has several nice features as stock, including metal fenders, rear wheel valances for keeping small feet and other things out of the wheel, a fold-down handlebar for easier storage and transport of the bike, hydraulic dropper-type seat, and a large rear rack ready for a large number of accessories including seats, panniers, cargo racks and more. A central small soft-sided storage bag is included for things like bike locks, gloves, snacks and so forth.
 
Aventon also continues to be a leader in bicycle visibility, and the Abound features tires with reflective striping, a bright LED headlight mounted above the front fender, plus a bright rear tail and brake light with integrated yellow LED turn signals activated by two buttons on the controller pod on the left handlebar, a feature it shares with the new Aventure.2. A color LCD display shows signal activation, speed, assist mode (Eco, Tour, Sport, Turbo, and Off), battery level, and some motivational environmental statistics (trees saved, CO2 reduced).
 
Construction is continuing on Aventon Lana, a 396-unit community in Clearwater, Florida. Construction started on the venture in 2021 and is now leasing for 2023. Homes range from one-bedroom to three-bedroom layout plans, measuring 737 square feet to 1,484 square feet each.
 
At this time, rent does not appear to be publicly available. However, according to Rentcafe, the average cost of rent for a 926-square-foot apartment in Clearwater hovers around $1,749 a month. This number may or may not reflect the cost of living at Aventon Lana.
 
Scott + Cormia Architecture and Interiors, LLC designed the complex in the modern architectural style. The venture itself cost around $61.3 million to complete. Aventon-HQ is both the owner and general contractor. The organization is based in North Carolina and has three active projects totaling $113 million.
 
Our shipping policy is divided into two categories: 1. Large heavy items requiring special freight or hazmat shipping certification (i.e. electric bikes, scooters, and e-bike batteries), 2. General merchandise. The majority of accessories, apparel, and other gear is designated as 'General Merchandise' and falls under our standard shipment processing time. For large heavy items, shipping time is longer depending on the type of shipment and regulatory requirements.
 
**Standard Shipment Processing**: For all merchandise that does not require hazmat certification or else require private freight service, orders are processed within 2-3 business days. Orders are not shipped or delivered on weekends or holidays. The retail shop is closed on Sundays and Mondays during the winter months and closed on Monday only during the summer months. If making an order during the winter season on Saturday night, the actual order will not be processed until Tuesday morning. Once processed, most shipments are carried by USPS and follow their general time-table for delivery.
 
**Large Heavy or HAZMAT Shipment Processing**: For most bicycles, e-bikes, trikes, automobile hitch carriers, large-capacity lithium ion batteries, mopeds, and electric scooters, shipment processing time is between 3-5 days. Once processed, we expect delivery to occur anywhere between 8-14 days. This is a general rule of thumb.
 
**Items such as trikes, heavy bikes sent on a pallet:**It is a complicated process to mount a vehicle on a pallet that requres skills not only to strap it and wrap around with a plastic but also requires a special attention to the details, therefore:
 
Once the freight was opened (took down stretch wrap and cut straps), item may not be returned. If there are damages occured during shipping, please send us an email with details and we will get in touch with the carrier and insurance company to reimburse you.
 
**Most Electric Bikes are required by IATA and federal transportation regulatory oversight to be shipped by Hazmat Ground**. This means that the item has to go by ground travel due to its Dangerous Goods classification (9) which will take longer depending on the freight carrier we select. Once the item is packed and labeled, you will receive a tracking number for your purchase and can follow its progress to your door. We insure each item we ship to the fullest value. Sometimes, ground shipping puts extra stress on the shipping container - whether a wooden box, or a cardboard box. We over-pack all of the equipment in the box - especially when we are tasked with building the vehicle, testing- and test-riding the vehicle, writing up a QC (quality check) report, and then repacking the vehicle. Many brands require this added level of safety and testing from an authorized dealer. When we do this, we re-pack the vehicle into a larger box with added foam and bubble wrap. We do this because of the extra carrier time and movement that will occur by ground freight.
 
If you receive a box that looks badly damaged - or heavily worn - please do NOT open until you take a full set of pictures of each side of the box. This is for insurance purposes only. If you receive a heavily used or damaged box (rips, tears, holes), please make sure to take multiple pictures of the box and the contents. In MOST cases, our over-packing will protect the vehicle from even the hardest use or abuse. Don't assume that damaged box means damaged goods. Take copious pictures as you unpack and you w
