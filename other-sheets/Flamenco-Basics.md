Although Flamenco is highly associated with Spain, it is still an Andalusian art form where it is still taught in homes through an oral tradition and occurs at informal gatherings called juergas. It is also taught formally in dance academies throughout Spain and has become a world wide phenomenon such that it has been declared a World Heritage Treasure by UNESCO in 2010. Flamenco aficionados from all over the world practice flamenco and flock to Spain every year for workshops and studies.

The 12 count rhythm generally starts on 12 and ends on 10 with the accents on 12, 3, 6, 8, 10. Whaaaaaat? Basically, the rhythm begins on the 12 count of the measure and then when it ends, it ends on 10.
 
Coordinating hand movements with footwork, turning, and body motion is one of the more challenging aspects to master in flamenco. The approach to teaching hand movements varies considerably among instructors, often influenced by personal preferences and aesthetics.

Historically, female dancers employed more intricate and ornate hand gestures, while male dancers favored straighter lines with less finger curling. Today, these distinctions have become less rigid, allowing dancers to express their personal preferences in shaping their hand movements.
 
Translates as hand clapping. The palmas provide the backbone of flamenco music and dance. Dancers use them often in choreography. Practising palmas will help deepen your understanding of flamenco rhythm. There are two kinds of palmas: Palmas sordas or cerradas (muffled or closed) create a muffled sound achieved by cupping the palms of your hands.
 
A workshop for students, musicians, and guitar aficionados who wish to enhance their technique by learning the basics of flamenco guitar. Open to auditors and members of the community with a background in classical guitar. Not exactly a beginner guitar course but all levels are welcome!
 
This workshop is **free admission**(courtesy of Bolton Guitar Studies, in collaboration with the Tucson Guitar Society), and **everyone is welcome**. Auditors can be a part of the workshop. While it is a course that will be helpful to any skill level, if you're just learning how to play it might be best to not try to play along right away. Instead, you should get a hold of Misael so he can assess your situation and proceed the best way possible. On the other hand, if you have any background on classical or even fingerstyle acoustic guitar, this workshop should be helpful to you! If you're just curious and would like to see if this would be a good fit for you, show up to the first meeting this Saturday (1/28/23) and check it out. Even if you don't play guitar and you're just interested in the subject you are more than welcome to be a part of the workshop as a listener.

The **Romani people** are a nomadic ethnic group that have spread a variety of music and artistic culture across much of Europe. They are often known by the pejorative term of **Gypsies** , and in Spain as Gitano. In the southwestern region of Spain lies the autonomous community of Andalusia, and it is from this rich culture that we find the art form known as Flamenco. Andalusia was not only populated by Romani's but a melting pot of Castilians, Moors, and Jewish settlers all adding to the richness of the Flamenco art form. Flamenco involves dance ( baile ), singing ( cante ), hand-clapping ( palmas ), finger-snapping ( pitos ) and of course guitar ( toque ) playing!
 
While the Flamenco guitar is similar to a classical guitar, it has its own particular build consisting of thinner tops and less internal bracing. Soft woods are used for the top and hardwoods are used to construct the back and sides. This method of construction leads to a **very loud and resonant sound** , but less sustain on notes, which is perfect because the Flamenco player will often play notes in quick succession. Flamenco guitars also have more of a percussive sound, not only are the strings plucked, but rhythmic finger tapping is used on the tap plate (which looks similar to a pick guard). This video shows well the differences between a classical and a flamenco guitar.
 
As mentioned above the guitar playing part of the Flamenco is known as the **toque** and the different musical forms in Flamenco are known as palos. While there are many different **palos** the most popular many readers may be familiar with are the tango , the fandango , solea , and rumba . Each palos is classified according to specific rhythmic patterns, chord progressions, scales, song subject, and stanza format. Many palos include traditional songs, and sometimes there is not a consistent method of classifying these songs. Some palos are appropriate during festivities, some are solemn songs for sadder occasions, some are perfect for dance, and still some tell stories of folklore and myth. To give you an idea of the variety of palos that exist this link here breaks most of them down.
 
The techniques used in Flamenco are very different, just as posture and strumming patterns are not the same as those used when playing classical guitar. The guitar player's legs are often crossed to support the instrument, and the elbow is used to support the upper right arm to help with the various right hand techniques. Flamenco players often play **between the sound hole and the bridge** to produce a more unique and raspy tone. When playing in flamenco style your fingers will often lightly strike the frets giving it that percussive sound. **Capos are often used** in this style to aid in key changes and produce a higher pitch. **Chords are often modified** to produce a droning quality while one finger remains to play specific melodic notes. The left hand doesn't always just pluck the strings, there are a variety of flourishes and finger taps used by the player. It is common for new students to be a bit bewildered by some of the left hand fingering techniques, but when done correctly they sound great. It is these **special rhythmic and percussive techniques** that give Flamenco music its feel and tone.
