The owners of apartments in the damaged Mascot Towers block in Sydney's south say new tests have detected a drop in the "bearing capacity of soils" close to where cracks first emerged in the building.

Owners voted at an annual general meeting on Tuesday to enter into a $5 million-plus, 15-year commercial loan to fund repairs, after some were unable to come up with the payments to meet a previously agreed $7 million special levy.
 
The update to owners said the structural engineer who inspected the building found the foundation conditions were "significantly worse than previously assumed", which meant the ability of the basement slab to provide an ongoing support had been "significantly compromised".
 
"At no stage has Aland been provided with a report or any evidence that links the waterproofing systems used in Peak Towers with the 'destabilisation' of land supporting Mascot Towers, so we are not aware of which engineers completed the report nor how they arrived at their conclusions if they have not had access to Peak Towers."

The owners of apartments in the damaged Mascot Towers block in Sydney's south say new tests have detected a drop in the \\\"bearing capacity of soils\\\" close to where cracks first emerged in the building.
 
\\\"Urgency has arisen following tests revealing a reduction in bearing capacity of soils at the north eastern corner of the building near the boundary of the Peak Towers development,\\\" the owners said.

\\\"With regard to the cracking and structural problems at Mascot Towers, it is a matter of public record that these issues surfaced several years before the Peak Towers development was constructed.\\\"

News of evacuations from cracked apartment buildings in Sydney and the need to replace combustible cladding across Australia illustrate how uncertainty compounds problems for those affected. Who is responsible for the remedy? Residents have had to leave their homes indefinitely, not knowing when their buildings can be repaired and made safe. Others remain in at-risk buildings with the constant worry about what might happen if fire breaks out.
 
Colson had studied the Gwemba Tonga of east-central Africa, in what is now Zambia. Villages of the Gwembe Tonga were faced with displacement due to the building of a dam on the Zambezi River. They were given a choice of where to settle.
 
Colson also told of how the group dealt with drought. Farmers had seed they could plant and then tend, but if they planted it too soon before the rains, the seed would be lost. If they planted it too late or failed to tend it, then the plants would not reach maturity, and they would have no crops for food and no seed for the next year.
 
There are also effects on rural communities of changes in international prices for mining and agricultural exports. Similar dynamics around uncertainty and blame apply to interned asylum seekers awaiting a government decision, the debate about coal seam gas development in Narrabri, and communities with groundwater contaminated by chemicals like PFAS.
 
In these examples, costs to individuals and families are potentially great relative to their resources. Resolution often requires a central role for large institutions, whether government agencies or multinational corporations.
 
Uncertainty due to a lack of information is being addressed in certain arenas. For instance, mathematical models to predict the weather are improving. The same can be said for models to predict shifts in international commodity prices.
 
The point here is that the true impact on residents of cracks in their apartment block, flammable cladding, an uncertain migration status, or PFAS in the groundwater is not merely the inconvenience or out-of-pocket expense. The impact includes prolonged uncertainty about very significant elements of their well-being. That has an impact on individual and community mental health, with potential flow-on effects to physical health.
 
The remedy involves a greater willingness by organisations and agencies to take on responsibility without delay and improved institutional relationships to arrive at suitable resolutions for the long term. So, our concern should not only be about the cracks in the buildings but about the fissures separating those who together could implement remedies.

For the last five years, you may have seen mention of Mascot Towers in and out of the [Australian] news ever since its residents were evacuated on 14 June 2019. Often it's referenced together with Opal Tower in any news related to The Building Commission NSW. However, rather than read about the ongoing drama and heartache experienced by the displaced residents the media seems to preference, you will be hard pressed to find a cohesive narrative as to what actually occurred. This is the story of Mascot Towers.
 
2008 saw the completion of a residential development comprising two ten storey residential towers, ground floor retail tenancies like grocery stores and coffee shops, all constructed above an underground train station. It was delivered by a builder on behalf of their developer client, the former City of Botany Bay Council. Certifiers acting on behalf of the council issued an occupation certificate (OC) on 1 July 2008. A valid OC is a requirement before occupying or using a new building. It means that the building has been independently checked for safety and compliance, and is in line with approved construction documents.
 
On 25 June 2019 NSW Deputy Premier, John Barilaro publicly declared a theory of his own (apparently based on geotech reports he had read[5]), that Mascot Towers was sinking due to a drop in the water table, once more attributing this drop to the neighbouring construction work.[6] The sinking the Deputy Premier likely referred to is known as differential settlement. This is where different parts of a building sink at different rates, causing tension to various building elements, eventually compromising the structure allowing part of it to move downward with the moving ground.
 
So far we have two deductions readily offered by public servants who have no qualms putting on building detective hats of their own. I can offer three more making a total of five hypothesis with the potential to explain our mystery of what caused Mascot Towers to move so much:
 
As always, the conclusion could feature a combination of more than one deduction, and still deductions we have yet to dream up, or reveal themselves during our investigation. All anyone can do is begin the process of eliminating each of these one at a time until we arrive at the deduction that is the most difficult to disprove. That might be our conclusion. Only when you can prove it using evidence is it absolutely your conclusion.
 
Interpreting cracks is an art in itself. Deductions can be made simply by understanding crack width, direction and context. In fact, there are whole books written on the subject to assist practitioners to develop their interpretation craft. The Practical Guide to Diagnosing Structural Movement In Buildings[8] by Malcolm Holland MRICS is an excellent resource, outlining first principals with clarity ahead of demonstrating how to apply them using a variety of examples. Malcolm suggests a user of his guide would be able to diagnose the majority of cracks within just a few minutes. CISRO also provides a white paper written for homeowners that provides a good, basic grounding in building movement and cracking[9].
 
Late one Friday evening in June 2019, just two months after Mr dos Santos purchased the property for close to $1 million, he and the building's other residents were rushed out in an emergency evacuation after significant cracks appeared in its support system.
 
The owners of Mascot Towers are now suing the developers and builders of Peak Towers, the property next door, for $15 million, alleging excavation work during the construction of the building caused the cracks in Mascot Towers.
 
However, in those court documents, the developer Church 88 and the builder Aland Development "deny these allegations and say that any damage to Mascot Towers has been caused by pre-existing building defects".
 
With bills and debts mounting and owners unable to sell the uninhabitable apartments, some residents like Mr dos Santos and Mr Najafian are now calling on the NSW Government to buy Mascot Towers back from residents.
