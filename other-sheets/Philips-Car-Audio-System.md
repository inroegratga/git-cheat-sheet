Hi, guys!
My screeneo just arrived 4 days ago, I tried connecting the 3.5 mm jack audio output of the projector to an RCA CABLE with the working TRS stereo connection standard connected in to my home audio system but no audio signal comes out of the projector and with other optoma projectors used in the past or televisions I have never had any audio connection problems.
 
I do not know whether this is a specific choice in the projector construction process or whether it is a real technical problem. Having said that, it certainly does not conform to what is stated both on the packaging and in the Philips product sheet.

Update with respect to this morning is that I succeeded to get permanent out out from my stereo system using HDMI instead of the 3.5 mm jack. These are the connections I set up: HDMI connection between my laptop and the projector (HDMI 1 port) + HDMI connection between the projector and my stereo system (HDMI 2 port, since this is the only one that supports ARC feature!).
 
Hi Daniele! Thank you for your message. I read your thread Screeneo U4 | Compact Ultra Short Throw - #180 by danbo and had the same problem. I connected my Apple TV via HDMI to the projector at the HDMI 1 input ( the input at the back of the projector, next to the 3.mm jack input ) and when I connect my RCA cable connected to a pjoneer apmlifier , the sound for 3/4 seconds can be heard and then it disappears and goes back to sound from inside the projector amp.

But the strange thing is that if I connect a pair of headphones and another pair of speakers the problem does not persist. I have also written to support but they have not replied yet. I then sent a PEC email to philips@legalmail.it to request an official solution from them.
 
Are people still having issues with Sonos / Philips HDMI arc? I gave up in the end and just use the optical connection instead. Works ok, but you can't use the Alexa functionality to control your TV.
 
Same issue here. My Philips TV **65PUS6754**appears to forget to initialise the HDMI ARC port on start up sometimes. Only way I have figured out to temporarily resolve is to switch off the tv and switch it on again. Incredibly frustrating, especially for two reputable brand names and expensive products. 

 
Hi, I'm brand new to Sonos and have to say so far very unimpressed. Spent over 1000 on Beam, Sub & 2 x SL speakers and cannot get TV audio to maintain a connection. Every time I turn the TV on I have to take the 60" TV off the wall, unplug everything and then plug them back in one at a time starting with Sonos then put TV back on wall. Then repeat this process every time TV is turned off. It's ridiculous. Will be retiring the Sonos unless someone has a permanent solution.
 
hello have the same problem with my philips 47PFL6007T / 12. When I go into TV settings and turn on and off easylink, the systems start to work together again. No solution to the problem but may point to the problem ...
 
hello everyone I'm having a problem with an audio system philips fwm583, it doesn't power on, yet the screen is showing the time, it only turn on when I set the timer, and when I press the power buton to power off it works, but it doesn't work when I try to turn on and the remote control is working well but it cannot turn on the system neither, I had to choose the phillips ds3000 because I didn't find my phillips audio system fwm583 on the list thank you so much if anyone is willing to help me.
 
Hi @jayeff Thank you for your answer, I could finally fix the audio system, the problem was the cd board, because the power goes through it and then to the front panel, also the cd tray was stuck and not pressing a button that allow the machine to keep working, I replaced the bad capacitors, cleaned the cd tray using some lubricant grease for cars and now it works with no problems at all, I couldn't imagine that the cd board was important, but thanks for your help
 
If the external sound system has an ARC-enabled HDMI cable, this is the preferred connection type. The advantage of using a HDMI-ARC cable is that only a single cable is needed to connect the TV to the sound system.
 
No further settings are required on the TV, the optical port will always send an audio signal while connected. The TV speakers will not automatically disable however, but can be turned off via the instruction in the box below.
 
If no digital connection is possible, the systems can be connected using a 3.5mm minijack through the headphone connector on the TV. This delivers an analogue stereo signal and can be converted to several different analogue connectors. Pictured above (RCA L / R to TRS adapter).
 
**Note**: the headphone jack transmits analog sound signals. This type of signal is transmitted slower than digital signals which can result in a synchronisation issue of video and sound.
 
Your TV only has an analogue audio out (red and white) cinch connection and **does not have a digital audio output**. The audio system must have an analogue audio input in order to work with the TV.
 
1) Switch the TV and the HTS off. 2) Connect the HDMI cable from the **HDMI OUT** connection on the HTS to the **HDMI** connection of the TV. 3) Switch the TV and the audio system on. 4) Play a disc on the HTS. 5) The TV will automatically switch to the HDMI input if:
 
6) If the TV did not switch to the HDMI input, ensure that the EasyLink feature on the TV and HTS is activated. 7) If your HTS is not HDMI CEC compliant, manually switch the TV to the HDMI device with the [Source] button on the remote control. Alternatively, you may add the new device(s) to the home menu and select the device via the home menu. 8) If you do not wish to hear the sound from the TV:

Until recently, Gibson Innovations was responsible for sales, marketing and distribution of Philips-branded audio and video products and accessories worldwide. Since its parent company Gibson Brands filed for Chapter 11 in the US on May 1, 2018, and its affiliates subsequently took similar steps in other countries, Philips explored several scenarios regarding the continuity of Philips-branded audio and video products and accessories.

The **Digital Sound System 80**, short **DSS80**, was a three-piece PC audio system co-developed by Microsoft and Philips. It debuted on the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E) and is most likely the only speaker system ever released by the Microsoft Corporation. It also remains one of the very few featuring Philips' wOOx subwoofer technology.
 
The DSS80 featured technological innovations in comparison with contemporary systems. For instance, it didn't require a sound card installed but actually featured its own integrated sound hardware which could be connected via USB and allowed digital quality playback, synchronized hardware and software volume controls, the use of a 10-band graphic equalizer and Microsoft Surround Sound.
 
To say the connector is ADB (Apple desktop Bus) is incorrect; any ADB device plugged into this port would not operate and likewise if the DSS80 were plugged into an Apple ADB port it would not function. Therefore, the only similarity is the Mini-DIN 4 connector type.
 
The pins on the DSS80 plug are connected to the following wires: with the index mark (labeled "B") at 12 o'clock, the pin at 2 o'clock connects to the black wire (speaker ground); the pin at 4 o'clock connects to the red wire (speaker hot); the pin at 8 o'clock connects to the yellow wire; the pin at 10 o'clock connects to the blue wire; and the ground sheath connects to the white wire. If you bypass the plug and wire the cable directly to the subwoofer, remember to mirror these connections.
 
The DSS80 was afflicted with a glitch concerning the main volume control. At times, when one of the buttons was held down, the volume would quickly increase to the maximum, or decrease to the minimum setting. The only way to stop this process was to hit the mute button. These issues seem to be resolved when connected to Windows Vista and Windows 7.
 
"Our acoustical engineers are not expert programmers. With Simulink they can quickly develop algorithms and test their ideas without writing any low-level DSP code. Only after identifying the best solution, sound algorithms are implemented on a DSP and committed to hardware."
 
For engineers at Philips Consumer Lifestyle Innovation Lab (iLab), surround sound audio technology is about more than sophisticated algorithms and electronics; it is also about evoking emotion in the listener. "We started thinking about how to embrace the listener with sound without a room full of wires and speakers," explains Georges Aerts, iLab Program Manager.
 
The result is the Ambisound Soundbar, a one-piece, integrated home theater system that uses advanced digital sound processing technology to deli
