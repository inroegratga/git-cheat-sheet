Most parents say 'we don't want to force our children for any degree . . . let them pursue what they like'. However, the fact is, in the name of well being & 'bright' future, parents dictate the verdict. When children try to share what they like, there is a strong argument (from parents' side) based on 'vast experience and/or multiple degrees & certifications' that they have. They say 'it is good, but what's the future'? E.g. A daughter wants to pursue Arts after 10th Std, not because of influence, but on account of her 'inner voice'. But before she completes her statement, there is an immediate 500db Arnab-style counter argument (yelling), 'what? Arts? Have you gone mad?' . . . acting as the Gods of the World of Work (based on their perceptions, & own success/failure stories). If this 'force' is based on some facts about the child, then it is acceptable . . .but if the basis is the perceptions about 'scope for some kind of work', then it is dangerous.

There is another angle to this, and that is - a Career-Triangle. Mrs. Wife, Mr. Father and Ms./Mr. Helpless (main Khiladi). The main fight is between the mother & father. They fight with each other on the 'climax' - meaning 'what is right for the child's future'. Their egos clash on 'who is best predictor' of child's future, rather than what is right for him/her. The third angle is that of a child with neither listening to him. This is like making someone act in a role that one is not convinced & passionate about. The result may be a flop film because of wrong cast. In some situations, the Khiladi gets influenced by friends, foreign country or teachers, and argues with the parents; not giving an ear to anybody. Here also the result may be the same.
 
In a nutshell, as parents, we either need to understand the true observed passion & talent of a child and discuss the career options with an open mind or seek an expert help to define his career path based on the 'uniqueness of his talent, personality & passion'.
