Personally I agree with you branryl but even if it was changed to be something simple, it would be kind of an issue. You see, the server is already a featured server which means everyone would connect by the featured server list anyway as it will send you to the nearest region you are in

Its alot harder than that, Hive has so many servers that theyl need to update so you dont join something else, and plus people who are using the hives ip theyd have to change and seriously, who can be botherd?? This would take a couple of days changing the ips off all there servers and getting their hosts to work with this and make sure everyone knows and sadly not everyone will be botherd to change so the hive will see a player decrease?
 
So this thing keeps happening where i make a skin in minecraft bedrock and when i go into hive i look like the skin i make and even when i press the down arrow to look at myself im as what i made. But for some reason with other people such as my friends, my skin is different to what i am. 1 of my frieinds saw me as a pig and one saw me as a whole other different character i have never seen before. Although it did not appear on my end. My friends sent me a video of me and how i look compared to what i saw on my screen.

Like what we have with the pets now (custom names for them) I believe that was a good test for them to see what people would do and what I see in the hub is not to bad. I feel like it would be similar to the pet names and the price would stay similarly to that. With the pets you can change the color of the name tag it should be the same with this idea.
 
Heya! Great suggestion, but this could get out of hand as people could use swear words or racist things that may offend others. Hive tries to keep their community kid friendly so sadly this cannot be a feature.
 
Hey, just wanted to comment on this message above. There is a reason as to why there are only 3 moderators right now. All moderation on our server is starting to be in the hands of our Player Support Team, which are people who get paid to moderate and offer support (they have the [Hive] rank on the server). So, there is no need to worry about a lack of moderation, as I can assure you that every report, for example, that is sent in gets looked at!
 
those arent the mods for the Minecraft server those are only for the forms. Second the PETS have custom titles you can use now. I dont see people abusing it in a bad way because hive moderation/ in game moderation can block certain words the moderation im talking about is in game not the people that are moderations.
 
Microsoft does not allow 1-to-1 communication between players, which is the reason why there is no private messaging feature on The Hive or any other featured server. This is also why party chat requires at least three players to be in the party.
 
Before a mod sees this and closes this. This could work with a mail group chat, the group sizes could be different sizes based upon having hive+ or not. A regular group starts at 3 and could go up to 8, while a hive+ group could have up to 16 players in a mail group. This allows you to message players while their offline and helps you look for players to play with you.
 
This would be impossible to moderate. Just imagine the amount of people (groups of two or more) that would actively group chat random players, leaderboad.players, rule breakers or other players just to annoy them or to spread toxicity.
