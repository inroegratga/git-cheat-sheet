Before and after on my old trailer. had this wheel chocks system built. Pull Two pins and it is removed to open up the entire floor space. Painted some free cabinets and put a solid wood top for a workbench. Standard closet rack system above to hang gear.
 
Spent quite a few years competing in BBQ with enclosed trailers very similar to what people are doing with moto trailers. One of my favorite quick tips is to find white epoxy paint for the walls and ceiling. That paint sticks to anything and its insanely durable for clean up. The white really lights up a trailer without much effort. Used Epoxy floor kits on the floor as well and could pressure wash them out. Have more pork and beef fat spattered everywhere than what an old KTM leaks in oil.

Ill share some photos of my build me and my wife built a couple years ago, we did it on a budget as well bought a used trailer and got quite a few items from a wrecked travel trailer someone was parting out, miscut flooring from Lowes, etc. 6 X 12 trailer with 6' 8" ceilings, its has 12 volt power with a large battery, along with 120v power when hooked to power or a generator, running water with a 25 gallon drum underneath the counter tops along with an outdoor shower. We added windows, a max air fan in the ceiling which makes a huge difference in air flow.
 
The bed raises up with ratcheting straps that are bolted into the metal studs and that leaves room for a bike underneath or to hangout if its nasty out. We always put one in the trailer and one in the bed of the truck but a slightly bigger trailer you could easily fit two bikes underneath. This works great for us as we travel alot but obviously not necessarily the best setup for just a day of riding which we usually just take the truck for that, this is more of a mini toy hauler.
 
Dang472, just curious if you installed the eTrac on the wall. If so, did you drill all the way through the exterior panel as well? I have a "laminated (read cheap to make) Carogmate and need to do something similar.
 
I'm building out a 6x12 and in a group called cargo trailer toy hauler conversions on FB. I suggest anybody give that page a follow. Rooftop AC's are out everybody goes with mini splits now. Apparently more efficient and less noise and no holes in the roof.
 
The Three-Rail trailer loves company. So go ahead, load three dirt bikes, sport bikes, scooters, adventure bikes, or lightweight standard bikes and hit the road. You can even load two heavier bikes or a combination of bikes as long as you have the space and you stay below the 1,500-lbs. capacity limit. Take the family. Take some friends. Go. Ride.
