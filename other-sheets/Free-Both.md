I've been seeing alot of Code Executions on Palo Alto Threat logs, most of them are not applicable on our servers and had an action of "Reset-both". Did the Firewall completely blocked the connection or there's a connection happened but did not complete since both server and client had a RST.

Question trying to resolve a logging issue we are using thresholds to block-ip source our Qradar instance is not seeing the block-ip logs all logging function are functioning properly from our Pano. I was going to turn on log at session start and also considering changing it to see if reset-both would show up. Any thoughts or explanations would be helpful thanks.
 
Some things in life truly are either-or, but many are both-and. Ancient wisdom traditions such as Buddhism and Taoism understand and teach the paradoxical nature of reality. They develop a non-dual mind. Here are a few examples from my own life where I was taught to think in a dualistic, either-or mentality, but the truth is much more of a non-dual, both-and nature.
 
If, like me, you are accustomed to dualistic thinking then non-dual thinking is challenging, especially at first. Holding two seemingly opposite concepts at the same time can make your mind feel like it is going to explode! But it is worth practicing nonetheless. You can get better and more comfortable with non-dual thinking over time. When you are quick to view things as contrary pause and ask yourself: Might these actually be complements? Might both be true at once? When you default to an either-or model of how you should feel (e.g,. happy or sad) pause and remind yourself that you can actually feel both on the same day, in the same hour, and even at the same time (an incredibly freeing realization).
 
So now, how can I make sure I am really keeping the components on both the side? I can select different layer and do thinks like power plane creation etc. but component placing part is not clear to me.
 
You will need to use vias. As you have such a beginners question i suspect you might be interested in this: Tutorial: Introduction to PCB design with KiCad version 5.1 (Getting Started) (For your current question: see section Vias for Connecting GND pads.)

Most common technique is adding adhesive paste to the components soldered in first place so they cannot fall down when the card is flipped and heated in the oven the second time. This is the purpose of the F.Adhes and B.Adhes layers in Kicad.
 
I believe this may be a mechanical problem related to the wheel axle length. If I apply mechanical pressure to the left on the wheel while scrolling, the problem goes away. This kind of pressure forces the wheel axle further into the encoder slot and thus makes a better connection between the wheel and the encoder.
 
I own a mouse model MS5320W that had the same problem with the mousewheel. I've fixed it cleaning it with contact cleaner. After a good spray in both sides of the wheel and a few seconds to dry out, it was smooth as new.
 
The same problem, it wasn't enjoyable. found this thread. I have Alienware wired/wireless gaming mouse. I had it for just over a year. It is model number AW610M- Lunar Light. I sprayed CRC Brand QD Electronic Cleaner on both sides of the wheel. It dries in seconds. Plugged back in, and whoosh, it works like new. Thanks for the tip TgEtGe!
 
I have two dell mice doing the same thing. Laptop and my desktop. Cleaned both and they are still doing it and it is driving me crazy. Both of the mice are just about 1 year and a couple months in production.
 
Had same issue with my Dell MS116P and just decided to search on youtube for a cleaning fix and found this and the cleaning of the internal scrolling wheel did the trick also applied wd40 on the clicks as well, now the mouse is functioning as new.
 
Baseline:
 3.4 percent of adults aged 18 years and over with co-occurring substance use disorders and mental health disorders received both mental health care and specialty substance use treatment in 2018
 
Adults with both a mental health and substance use disorder often get treated for one or the other but not both. An approach that treats both disorders together is critical for getting people the care they need.

Instead of trying to fix each other, partners should focus on cleaning that murky water. After the water is cleaned up, both partners can dive below the surface of what appears to be going on to discover what is actually going on.

The U.S. immigration system is a massively complicated machine, with a lot of worn-out parts. How to fix it? Step one: Get hold of some actual facts and evidence. (We did this step for you.) (Part two of a three-part series.)
 
Remember, the National Origins Act of 1924 had severely constrained immigration to the U.S., both in number as well as countries of origin. In his book, Leonhardt describes how John F. Kennedy wanted to undo this, in the early 1960s.
 
LEONHARDT: I think he and the people around him genuinely believed that the immigration system of the time was grossly unfair. I mean, two-thirds of all immigration slots were given to just three countries: Britain, Germany, and Ireland.
 
DUBNER: Did the advocates ignore those possibilities because they had motivated reasoning, they just wanted to see the upside? Were they really bad at math, perhaps? Or did they just not understand how much demand there was out there?
 
We heard a lot of that evidence in the first episode in this series. For instance: the children of immigrants climb the economic ladder at a higher rate than the children of parents who were born in the U.S. Nearly half of the companies in the Fortune 500 were founded by immigrants or their children.
 
DUBNER: What do you think the U.S. would look like today, economically and socially, politically, etc., etc., if the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 had never existed, and the U.S. had continued on its low-immigration path?
 
The U.S.C.I.S. is the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. It was founded in 2003, as part of the Department of Homeland Security, and it now oversees all immigration to the U.S. The agency it replaced was the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
 
MAHADEVAN: No. The funny thing is, if you live in the U.S., you become very familiar with immigration. You just get to know this stuff. Because you have to know the rules of your visa status. You have to know what happens when it ends. You kind of have to figure out how to swim.
 
DUBNER: So I understand that you became a sort of immigration nerd, yes? That you got to know the policies and regulations inside and out. Was that on purpose, or was that just the process of you learning a lot about the system because of your personal involvement?

Because of its sudden appearance, and because the world does not wait for us to figure out the best possible approach before the new semester starts, I am disinclined from being too judgmental about the different choices instructors are making on how to deal with ChatGPT being in the world.
 
In both the case of ChatGPT and of calculators, the answer is no, but I think not necessarily for the same reasons, and the difference is important when it comes to thinking deeply about how to move forward.
 
Given that this is the case, forbidding students from using calculators in a math course closes them off from spending more time practicing the kind of thinking math requires, as opposed to working through those mechanical operations by hand.
 
Writing is thinking. It is both the expression and the exploration of the subject of the writing. The act of writing both requires thinking about how to best present the material to the intended audience and is a chance for the author to process and refine their own knowledge and understanding about a subject.
 
However, while I think pursuing a long-term banning of ChatGPT is the worst possible approach to the future, I also think that training students on how to make use of ChatGPT in all their writing would also be a significant mistake.
 
Students should still be doing lots of writing where ChatGPT is not only not necessary but is largely irrelevant to what they are doing. Even in skilled hands, overrelying on ChatGPT for the language that winds up in a written product risks derailing the important exploration of an idea that happens when we write. This is particularly true in school contexts, when the learning that happens inside the student is far more important than the finished product they produce on a given assignment.
 
Learning is rooted in experiences. A calculator doing long division or churning through a formula is not robbing students of experiences that they must do over and over again to continue to learn. The same is not true of AI like ChatGPT and writing.
