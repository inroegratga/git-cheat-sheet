As everyone has to learn to type at some point, so why not learn this basic computing skill properly today? Knowing the right touch-type technique is useful for everyone. It will make you a more efficient worker as you will be able to type faster and more correctly.Knowing the right touch-type technique and posture will also help to avoid discomfort. Ergonomics is a very important part of keyboarding. Good ergonomic practice helps to avoid physical discomfort that may accompany prolonged static postures and repetitive motions. Work-related injuries such as tension in the neck and shoulder area, which are common problems for people working in front of a computer, can be avoided by following some simple ergonomic guidelines.
 
Keyboarding is learned finger by finger. Each finger has its own set of keys. Most keyboarding programs are designed so that they first introduce a new key. This key is first practiced on its own and in small words containing the letters that have been taught so far. Then the exercises move on to longer words, sentences, and text drills. Repetition and continuous practice make you a master. Little by little you become faster and more accurate typist.

As touch-typing is a cumulative motor skill, it would be ideal to practice daily or at least every second day. Developing good keyboarding skills throughout the course is also essential. Therefore, proper touch-typing should be reinforced whenever possible, preferably for at least 15 minutes every day. Of course, this is not always possible.

Variation in motor skill acquisition is great between individuals so it is difficult to set a definite minimum or maximum limits to a keyboarding session, but, in general, short periods of practice will yield better results than very long sessions. For best results, daily practicing periods should vary from 15 minutes to about one hour in length.
 
To reduce stress in shoulder area, keyboard and mouse should be placed next to one another so that reaching is not necessary. Chair height and/or work surfaces must be adjusted so that the wrists and forearms remain in a straight line. Usually the best working posture for your arms is achieved when the input devices are at about elbow height.
When working for long periods of time staring at a computer display it is important that the neck constantly remains in a relaxed position. Therefore the monitor must be placed and tilted so that it is directly in front of the user at or below eye level. This ensures that the head is not turned to left or right or awkwardly tilted upwards, which causes a lot of strain to neck and shoulder area. Placing the documents adjacent to the monitor or directly below it also helps to avoid neck pain when the students do not have to constantly twist and turn their necks. The monitor must be kept clean.
 
There are a few useful guidelines that should always be kept in mind when working on a computer. It may be a good idea to print out these guidelines and keep them near workstation so that they can be easily referred to whenever necessary. 
- Do not lift your shoulders, this causes tension.
- Rest your elbows close to your body. Use armrests whenever possible.
- Do not bend or twist your neck.
- Keep your forearms and wrists in a straight line.
- Keep your fingers slightly curved.
- Keep your feet flat on the floor or on a footstool.
- Use a light touch when you write on computer.
Remember that no position or posture is correct for long periods of time. Remember to change positions frequently, take small breaks and stretch or even walk around a bit. Regular movement will prevent discomfort and fatigue effectively.
 
Whether typing is faster than writing depends on various factors such as individual proficiency, the task at hand, and personal preferences. Touch Typing tends to be faster for most people. It allows for quick edits, easy sharing, and efficient data input. However, some individuals may still find comfort and focus in the traditional act of writing by hand. Ultimately, the choice between typing and writing depends on the context and the individual's comfort and proficiency with each method.

 1. Keyboard and mouse placement: The keyboard and mouse should be positioned at a comfortable height and distance from your body, so you don't have to reach or stretch to use them.

 2. Wrist posture: Keep your wrists straight and in line with your forearms while typing to reduce the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome and other wrist injuries.

 3. Keyboard angle: The keyboard should be angled slightly downward, with the keys facing you. This can help reduce strain on your hands.

 4. Keyboard tilt: The keyboard should be tilted slightly away from you, so your wrists aren't bent upward while typing.

 5. Chair height: Adjust your chair so your feet are flat on the floor and your thighs are parallel to the ground. This can help prevent back strain and promote good posture.

 6. Monitor placement: The top of your computer monitor should be at or slightly below eye level, so you don't have to strain your neck to see it.

You can't learn to swim without getting wet; likewise, you can't learn to touch type by looking down at the keyboard. It might be hard at first but hang in there, and in no time it will become so natural you'll forget the keyboard is even there!
 
If you have trouble finding a key resist the urge to look down. Instead, use the onscreen virtual keyboard with orange highlights telling you where the key is and what finger to use. Put a towel over your hands if you still can't resist.- Technique and Accuracy FirstConcentrate on correct form (using the right fingering, etc.) and accuracy above all else.
