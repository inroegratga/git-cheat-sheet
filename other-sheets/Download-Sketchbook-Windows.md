While uninstalling an app can sometimes fix issues, it often does more harm than good. If you're having trouble with Sketchbook, **please we are begging you reach out to us** at support@sketchbook.com before uninstalling and reinstalling the app.
 
**Android** - uninstalling and reinstalling will delete your brush customizations, custom color palettes, your preferences, your Gallery organization, and any unsaved progress on an open canvas. Saved files will not be deleted by an uninstall/reinstall, you will be prompted to recover your Gallery after restarting the app.

**iOS** - **WARNING!** Uninstalling and reinstalling the app will **delete everything including all your saved artwork**. This data will not be recoverable without restoring your device from an earlier backup.
 
We are unable to update older versions of Autodesk SketchBook on desktop because the licenses are tied to Autodesk. These are still great apps though and you can continue to use them for as long as you like, however they cannot receive updates or bug fixes.
 
If you received Autodesk SketchBook as a pre-load on your Windows tablet, that version (5.x) was discontinued and cannot be redownload. Be aware that if your tablet is factory reset, the app will be deleted and cannot be reinstalled.
 
So I'm brand new to Arduino and I get this message every time I try and open the newest software version (0022): "Arduino cannot run because it could not create a folder to store your sketchbook." I have deleted and reinstalled everything several times, tried passed versions of the software, and nothing works. Still haven't gotten the program to open. Please help! I have a secret knock gumball machine just waiting to come to life! Thanks.
 
Thanks for the reply. I'm pretty novice with all this stuff, so please anyone correct me if I'm wrong. As far as I can tell, Mac doesn't have a administrator mode. Under the Accounts area of my preferences it has me listed as the admin, so it looks fine to me. When I go to "get info" upon right-clicking my applications folder it says "you can read and write". So, things being as they are, I don't even know what to try and change. Any other ideas?
 
Actually, I didn't unzip anything when I downloaded the Arduino software. It came as a .dmg that simply has the Arduino icon, my applications folder, and a driver that I apparently don't need because I'm using the UNO (I tried anyway after a while and it changed nothing). You drag the Arduino icon over into the applications folder, it copies real quick, and that's it. When I search my computer as a whole and the files within the Arduino software (by right-clicking and selecting "show package contents") there is nothing named sketch or sketchbook anywhere.
 
Another note... I've come across several people writing in a location for the sketchbook in the preference.txt file manually. I haven't found anything that works, but I couldn't help but notice that there is nothing in the preference folder that has "sketch" or "sketchbook" mentioned. Wouldn't the location of the sketchbook folder be mentioned in the preference code? Does anyone know how to manually fix this on a mac? Am I even on the right path here?

Look in the /Libraries/Arduino for the preferences.txt. It should have a sketchbook.path line; maybe it points to a folder that doesn't exist? You can either delete the whole preferences.txt or try to manually edit that line to point to a folder that does exist (e.g. make one called "Arduino" in your Documents folder).
 
Fixed it! My documents folder (which is where Arduino tries to write the sketchbook folder) was set on "read only". There was never any sketchbook line of code in the preferences - not sure why that is, but oh well. Thanks again for your help. Sorry it was such a basic fix.
 
Hi i am having this very same problem.
Please advise: I have the Downloaded zip file (has been unzipped)
and running the program i get the same "could not create a folder to store your sketchbook"
 
In my case, I think the Arduino IDE was having issues because my Docs folder is redirected to a network share and couldn't figure out how to make a sketchbook folder on "\storage\users(My user name)\Documents\Sketchbook"
 
Krita sees the file and allows me to load it both on my Galaxy Tab 7fe and on the Windows 11 version but it loads as a single blank layer instead of the 7 proper layers. When I import back into sketchbook on my tablet it works correctly.
 
I ended up using a 7 day trial of sketchbook on my pc to get it done. I saved it as a PSD and my Windows 11 version opens the file just fine but the Android one all the photos are blank or mostly blank with colored lines running through them.
 
Transcribing and refining sketches using an app like OmniGraffle. (Time-consuming, and loses some of the spontaneity and ambiguity that sketches have and which can lead to good things. This will be the subject of a future post.)
 
A smart sketchbook would be to a sketchbook what a smart phone is to a phone: it should provide the basics (sketching, taking down notes) while augmenting them with the ability to obviate the digital-analog divide outlined above. It should allow me to capture ideas with the fluidity, precision, and freedom afforded by paper, but directly into digital so that I can enjoy all the benefits and flexibility afforded by the digital medium: fast random access to my work, treating digital objects as part of the subject matter and canvas of my doodling, easily sharing and/or collaborating on ideas, etc.
 
I waited a while to upgrade after Windows 8.1 came out, and there were still driver snafus and little technical niggles to deal with when I did. These types of inconveniences are rare in Appleland; I wish my Windows sketchbook were as reliable and trouble-free as my Apple devices. If you decide to tread into these waters, be prepared to set aside time for hunting down and fixing tech issues with the OS.
 
This book introduces poetry as a genre and acquaints the reader with the terminology of the art in clear, accessible language. The sketchbook approach is beneficial because it first introduces terms and concepts necessary for interpretation and understanding, illustrates the term or concept with relevant and engaging poems, and then encourages a written response in a sketchbook journal. The readers' poems can be modeled on a selection from the chapter or from the Poembank. The Poembank is an anthology of over sixty poems by a culturally diverse group of poets; from Alice Walker to Carl Sandburg, from Naoshi Koriyama to Langston Hughes.
 
A unique format for a poetry workbook, the sketchbook is the cornerstone of the image of poetry as a "house of possibility" (Emily Dickinson's term) in which there are many windows and mirrors. A poem may allow us to see exactly what the poet saw, felt, or experienced, as if through a window, or it may be a direct reflection of something we have seen, felt, or experienced, as if looking into a mirror.
 
*Windows and Mirrors* brings readers to an organic understanding of how a poem works not by first requiring that they analyze the poem, but by allowing them to respond to the poem with their own poems and then applying this new-found insight. Too often texts at the intermediate level over-emphasize analysis or are simply anthologies of standard well-known poems. Author Priscilla Adams brings together the elements of information, response, and interpretation in a format that middle-grade level students find appealing and challenging.

In this video we're going to take a look at the interface for SketchBook Pro. So, if your interface right now looks any different to mine, what I'd like you to do is go up to windows, and let's go to default layout. Now at the very top, we can see that we are using SketchBook Pro, it's an untitled document, and it's at 100% scale. Now it's untitled because I haven't created and saved this document and if I press the spacebar and I just go left and right, right in the middle of that puck, you'll notice that the scale value changes. At the very top we have a title bar with standard Windows options for file. For Edit, Image, Windows and Help. Let's focus on Windows for a second here. You'll notice that we have a check mark against Toolbar, Lagoon, Color Puck, Brush Puck and Brush Palette. If I uncheck those one by one, you'll notice it completely clears our canvas, until there's no download boxes at all. So if you ever lose a download box, you can always go back to Windows, Default Layout or Windows and then just check it from here. At the very top, we also have something called the Toolbar. Now this toolbar contains new functions in 2015 and it's going to be an essential part of our workflow. You can move it to any location you want, but typically I can leave it at the very top. We also have two pucks here, one is called a brush puck and one is called a color puck. The color puck, if I just tap one time, allows you to select your hue value from here and also your saturation and luminance values from the middle. We also have something called a brush puck and the brush puck allows you to change the diameter of the brush. Like so. Again, we're going to be covering these in more detail, later on. On the left-hand side here, we have a brush palette. We can move the brush palette to any location that we want to. Typically, I leave it on the left-hand side like so. If we pick one of these brushes, just hold the styles down and slide up and down, it reveals more brushes. Or we can just expand that dialup box like so. Now
