Open QuickTime go to quicktime menu, select service settings, mine did not have ticks only little blue lines so I selected - restore defaults button and now all is okay no more crashing or quicktime problems.
 
Yes I updated to Sonoma and QuickTime icon goes to the bottom of the screen but it won't open up on the screen to play anything. But I have downloaded Final Video Player app from the App Store it has a free version but it took ages to read the dvd in my portable dvd player for computers.

I cannot hide the quicktime player panel in Sonoma operating system. Is there anyone else having the same problem? After selecting fade panel after inactivity in system settings, it still does not hide the panel. Thank you.
 
Both QuickTime Player and Apple TV are Apple products. You would think that Apple in developing updates in OS would have compatibility with these products. Is there no solution from Apple experts? My equipment is MacBook Air M1 2020 - 16 GB Memory. I have also had a problem with Apple Mail freezing since I updated to Sonoma. The issue with Apple Mail happens in two scenarios - an email with a large attachment or an email with hundreds of BCC email recipients. The email is stuck in Outbox and the program will not open without freezing immediately. I'm sharing this email issue in this thread about video players with this question. Could the freezing issue be due to a memory issue (though I have 16 MB)?
 
I'm having a different but probably related problem. When I try to play a video with Quicktime, the computer doesn't freeze, Quicktime doesn't hang, but instead QT treats the mpeg file like an audio file and plays only sound, with a bit of popping and hissing mixed in. The issue recurred with every file I tried. QT Version 10.5 (1170.4.13.1). Sonoma 14.1.1 (23B81). MacBookPro18,3.
 
I am using an LG screen mirrored, supplied by Apple with my 16inch M1 Max connected via the original USB-C cable supplied with the monitor. I cannot be the only editor in the world using this screen in this mode. APPLE need to sort this one quick time.
 
This issues happens with me when I try screen capture. I press record. Nothing happens no control bar. Try to save No options Only way out is to Quit- no recording major workflow problem for teacher using QuickTime to teach !!!
 
I have the same issue on an M1 MacBook Air running the latest macOS Sonoma. When opening "some" video files with QuickTime it will cause the entire operating system to freeze, this is serious freeze as the entire OS becomes unresponsive. At this point the machine must be forcibly shut down by holding down the power key.
 
Seeing that a Live Wallpaper is essentially a video file being played back, my intuition is telling me that the Live Wallpapers feature introduced in Sonoma is the cause of the issue. I recently disabled Live Wallpapers & Screensavers, setting my wallpaper to a still image and using a screensaver that was included in previous macOS versions. After doing these things, I have not seen the issue re-appear, yet.
 
After some testing and research, the issue appears to be in how Displays are currently being handled in Sonoma while in mirrored mode. Throughout the crashes, my M1 MacBook Air was attached to an external monitor in mirrored mode. When changing this mode to extended, it has been a week now using Quicktime exclusively for video playback without crashes. Crashes do not occur when no monitor is attached to MacBook Air. If you are using your display in mirrored mode please switch to extended mode and let us know if you see any more crashes.
 
That is the first logical observation I have seen so far regarding this crashing issue, have observed 6-7 crashes since update to Sonoma, all times the external monitor was connected in mirror mode. Not sure why that should cause a crash, but I can also observe how this behaves in extended display mode.
 
It was reported in November. Had several crashes. Apple support contacted me around Christmas. Later beggining of January **I have provided everything** - sys logs, logs while it crashed, **video taken with my iPhone while crashing** and the **video file that caused** the crashed.
 
Pretty much same issue. Not sure what device you are using but mine is 14" pro, less than 12 months old. Since, update to Sonoma , it has frozen and rebooted 10+ times, never before that, never had to reboot Mac in past.
 
A few comments below someone mentioned about this happening with external monitor connected on mirror mode. Could you please let us (co-sufferers) know if you are using external monitor while this is happening.
 
Clicking desktop creates this dark band around the desktop, this sends all open windows into oblivion, pushing them towards the edges out of view. I think some applications don't like being treated this way, I have had issues with Quiktime Player and also with Windows Remote Desktop, causing system crash.
 
I am just another person on this forum suffering from this ill-tested feature release by apple. But since my laptop is not crashing after this setting change, I wanted to share.... and also get your feedback
 
Same issue on my 2020 M1 MacBook Pro. The Mac has been running flawlessly before I upgraded to Sonoma, now when doing anything with QT Player for a shorter or longer amount of time the system hangs or freezes and then the Mac reboots after a while. Very annoying as my job requires heavy use of QT Player.
 
Well now we have the issue listed on a university's campus website as it has undoubtably been affecting many students that have upgraded their MacBooks to macOS Sonoma. They have linked back to this thread as reference. This is a very serious issue with macOS Sonoma that needs to be fixed ASAP.
 
Just put in the latest Sonoma after endless crashes on the 14.0. Now we are on 14.1.2 and still \*\*\*\*\*\* off that I can't get through my workflow involving videos in vlc or Resolve or qt player. Can not get through a video without a system FREEZE. Pathetic that APPLE does not respond or do SOMETHING. Guess they are clueless.
 
I am experiencing the same with use of QuickTime and macOS Sonoma 14.2.1 (23C71). When I create a screen recording all goes well however when I review the recording my system will hang and the beachball will appear. Sometimes my computer will reboot on its own saying an issue occurred and other times I have to complete a force reboot. I did not experience any issues with use of QuickTime when my laptop was on macOS Ventura.
 
That is great to hear that you are no longer having an issue but I and others are on macOS Sonoma 14.4.0 and the issue is not resolved. The whole point of having this issue resolved is so that we can have video playback using QuickTime with an external monitor attached and in mirrored mode.
 
Now, running 14.0 and with the external monitor disconnected, I can succesfully play an .mp4 file in QuickTime Player. So, it seems to me this problems involves some issue with external monitors ... maybe older external monitors?
 
The latest release of many Adobe products is not fully compatible with Catalina. OSX 10.15 completely dropped support for any 32-bit apps so Adobe is not the only casualty. Most of the components in most complex apps are now 64-bit apps, but all it takes is one block of code somewhere deep inside an app to kill the process. The problem with some forms of Quicktime is that Apple didn't exclude the QT player from the 64-bit spec so if you render to a codec that uses only 32-bit technology Catalina
 
When rendering, I had to click 'lossless' and then click the format options and change the Video Codec to something else (e.g. Apple ProRes 422 HQ) and QuickTime played it fine. Apparently QuickTime just doesn't like when the it is set to Animation but obviously if you need to use that I'm not sure what the fix would be. Hope this helps

It's that simple, and there is nothing that Adobe can do to change how QuickTime works. Your only option is to render to a compatible format. If you use a lot of 3rd party plug-ins and even scripts you will also have to wait for those to catch up to 64-bit. Don't count on everyone that has ever made a plug-in for AE to spend the money and time required to update their product to 64-bit.
 
Apple warned everybody that this change was coming and that you had to be careful. That's why I have not upgraded yet. I won't for a while. Just before I do I will make a mirror fresh backup (mirrored copy) of my boot drive so that if there are any apps critical to my business that stop working after the upgrade I can revert to the previously working OS in a matter of minutes. I do this automatically every 30 days with my machine all the time anyway. I have for years. I use a boot drive cloning app that I start on the last Saturday evening of the month so I am never without a way to boot to a backup that was working fine. My whole computer could burn down and I could buy a new one, turn it on, and boot to the cloned drive and be right back to where I started in just a little more time than it
