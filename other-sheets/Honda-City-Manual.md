I got a Honda city 1.3 manual transmission in march. I have driven 5000km. Since beginning the gear shifting is hard, specifically the shifting back and forth between 1st and 2nd gear and down from 3rd to 2nd gear is hard. It feels like I have to push against some obstacle to shift gears. I complained to Honda dealer Honda south in Karachi after 1000km. The first two times I sent car, they just did road test and said there is no problem. The third time, I took the car they kept the car for 3 hours. They said that they bled the clutch and it should now be ok. 
I still feel that shifting in 1st and 2nd gear is hard. I have driven local assembled manual Suzuki and Toyota cars and feel that Honda city gearshifting feels abnormal.
I would like to know the experience of other Honda city users.

an addition in my observations, sometimes when in first gear, when I shift to second, the gearshift springs out of place. I noted that first gear is very hard and difficult to shift to and from. I also note that the car is knocking in first gear and very poor pickup in first gear. 
I would appreciate any comments from Honda city users or experts.
 
thanks for your reply. Though its been a while but hope you can respond again. I try to explain the problem to Honda South but they dont seem to want to understand it. Each time they go for a test drive and say there is no problem in car. I even mentioned and asked them to check the selector but they are not willing to even take the car into workshop for checking it. Just do test drive and say we will contact Honda and ask for their second opinion. Now I have had this car for nearly a year and drove 16000km. Car has very poor pickup on slopes. Cant drive it up a slope without it turning off once. from 1st to 2nd gear, sometimes it shifts with a jerk like a jumping out feeling.
I dont know if this is just a driver comfort problem or a problem that can turn into breakdown or major problem.

I.have a 2009 model. I also experienced the same problem. The Honda guys outrightly rejected anything wrong with my vehicle. I then went for a manual transmission oil change and voila! The hard gear grinding problem was gone. I had the oil changed when the car had accumulated roughly 10,000 kms. Since then, no problems!

As the statement says I need to change my manual honda city transmission model 2010 current shape to automatic 
Q 1.Is it possible easily? 
Q 2. How much would he the cost? 
I am in Lahore so a gokd mechanic recommendation will be required 
Regards
 
Thanks 
But I'm interested in this car cause it's with us since day one and only 50k driven no paint work at all atleast 9/10 
So finding another car of same year would mean alot of search and still I wont find a clean one as this.. So. My first priority is to get this converted
 
No worries mate. You can always find a clean car , it may take some time though. Nevertheles, Bol for the project, you gotta visit Bilal gunj if you are in Lahore bro.
Look for Honda specific shops. I am sure youl get all your answers there.
 
Thanks @biloo 
But finding a car is second option I will try to find a good deal for auto conversion my guess if it's around 50k then I would do it.... 
Any idea how much auto tranny would cost me from bilal gunj?
 
There may be other items which may need to be replaced with the auto compatible variants such as:
- the intake manifold (not sure about the city but for the Civic EK it was different for auto and manual variants)
- cooling system
- removal of the hydraulic clutch system of the manual
