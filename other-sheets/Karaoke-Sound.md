You might have the most impressive pipes in the whole of your city. You might sound like a strangled cat when you sing, especially after a few drinks. But whatever your range and ability, you will take to the stage for one of these karaoke songs. And it will be brilliant.

Choosing the right song is crucial. If you can't sing in tune, perhaps opt for a rap. If you want to show off that high range, potentially opt for a bit of Whitney. In our list of the best karaoke songs ever, we've got everyone from Madonna to Lizzo, and from Toto to Frank Sinatra. Take a shot and warm up those vocal chords, people. These are the best karaoke songs ever.
 
That riff, a cross between a sitar and a revving dirt bike, is the most recognizable thing about the song. For such a ubiquitous hit, the lyrics continually surprise beyond the titular chorus. So much so that when Cat Power covered the tune in 2000, slicing off the refrain, it was a strange new poem about the anxiety of commercials and subliminal advertising. This from the first rock band to develop a brand logo, a pair of juicy red lips.
 
I wonder why nobody can set up a karaoke system that works well? Why can't I find a karaoke bar with a good sound system? Why it's so difficult? Is there anything I can ask or check to know in advance if a karaoke bar is good or not?
 
Considering the mess dedicated 'sound operators' routinely make of a gig, yes, it's not surprising a DJ knows little beyond pumping sound in the general direction of the audience. But all but the most basic karaoke systems have a monitor speaker for the performer, through which he can hear both the track and his voice. However, a drunken karaoke performer cannot be trusted not to point his mic into this speaker, causing annoying (and possibly destructive) feedback. So a sensible karaoke operator will not put much vocals in the monitor. Also, a karaoke microphone will be mistreated, so it starts off cheap-and-nasty and rapidly gets worse.
 
I tried a couple of mixers from sound town and pyle that had HDMI in/out ARC ports as well as wireless microphones. Both systems did not function as advertised nor would they work in a passthrough mode if wanting to just watch TV. Can someone guide me to the equipment I should purchase if wanting to play YouTube videos as the karaoke source but use my existing system with wireless mics? I heard the Xbox has a karaoke game that you can attach a microphone to but it sucks

(note that the step by step doesn't say this but there is a final couple steps: selecting your new "Noise Cancelling Source" from the list of inputs in your sound settings and closing and reopening any apps that use inputs and or outputs (so that they switch to the new sources, spotify for example needs a restart to play music once again)
 
Hi Sound KTV(Karaoke) is the best private room karaoke in Pittsburgh. We also had a full bar offer many different kind drinks. We have six private rooms in a variety of sizes. The biggest room is capacity for 25-30 people.
 
Each room offers full multimedia capabilities from professional sound systems with 2 wireless microphones, 60-inch large screen Samsung Televisions and a 23inch touch screen for song searching and selection. Perfect for any after work events, birthday party, and private corporate events.
 
One of the good karaoke places in the city. It is open late into the night and has a good drink menu. The private rooms are really big, with a couch, a table to place your drinks and ample space inbetween the table and the screen.
 
This week, hosts Jim DeRogatis and Greg Kot take the show out of the recording studio and into the karaoke bar as they share some of their favorite karaoke tracks. They'll also hear selections from production staff and listeners.

If you've ever tiptoed in the karaoke world, you're bound to see these names: **Sunfly, Legends, Sound Choice, Party Tyme, Sweet Georgia Brown, Stingray, Vocal Star, Zoom, etc.**, whether it's when you're browsing for a song to sing at a karaoke bar, on Youtube (ugh), or in our Singa karaoke app. What are these karaoke brands? No wait, are they bands? Karaoke versions? Manufacturers? Official karaoke companies? Karaoke-song-providing something-somethings?
 
Before going further, if you want to skip the reading part and move straight to singing (no hard feelings, I get it), you can find over 80 000 karaoke versions of both classic and new songs online in Singa, just one click away.
 
Now, let's resume the business! What on earth are Sunfly, Legends, Sound Choice, Party Tyme, Sweet Georgia Brown, Stingray, Vocal Star, Zoom and all the rest? Surely they have nothing to do with the genres of music you like to sing or that the music comes from a computer or a disc. And they are everywhere.
 
**The answer is: they are karaoke companies and labels that produce and distribute karaoke versions of music.** Some of the above mentioned karaoke companies produce their own content, i.e., they make new recordings of your favourite tracks fit for karaoke use. Other may buy these karaoke versions from music producers and just distribute them on discs or as digital files. We'll get into the details now.
 
The above companies manufacture replicas of songs released by real artists. This means that the backing tracks used in karaoke are in fact not the original recordings of the songs, but reproductions. Shocking!
 
A karaoke producer is usually a professional musician who is capable of listening carefully to the original recording of a song and picking up the different instrument parts in the song. He/she then produces a similar instrumental track by either recording instruments or programming MIDI instruments with a computer. Depending on the song there may be various instruments used to make the new recording track sound as similar to the original as possible.
 
Once the instruments are recorded, the song may need backing vocals. Also a guide lead vocal track is usually recorded to help with syncing the lyrics on screen and for the karaoke singers to check the correct melody of the song. After recording the vocal parts, the karaoke producer typically creates two mixes of the song: a karaoke version and a full mix. The full mix is the cover version of the original song that has all the instruments and vocal parts. The karaoke mix has all the instruments and backing vocals but, of course, not the lead vocals.
 
With the full mix version, our karaoke producer is able to sync the text. It means to set the song lyrics to appear and their colours to change as indications of when they're supposed to be sung. This synching can be done with various programs, and sometimes a MIDI note is added, too. In Singa you can see the MIDI notes on top of the text when available, and you can choose to enable the guide lead vocals in song settings.
 
Different karaoke versions may vary a little in sounds and mood, or even in the keys they are in. The best way to choose the best karaoke version for you is by... surprise-surprise, singing to them! You can easily preview the different karaoke song versions in Singa and choose the one you like.
 
Another brand you have surely encountered is Sound Choice. It was founded in the US in 1985 by the Slep brothers, and is now distributed by the Canadian media company Stingray. The brand became known for the highest quality and has released more than 16,500 karaoke tracks.
 
Vocal Star is a UK-based karaoke company who produces high quality karaoke versions and also karaoke machines. The company was founded in 1994 by the karaoke and music enthusiasts Jay Taylor and Matt Coxon.
 
Are you a music producer interested in creating new karaoke tracks? While most of the biggest hits are already covered by established karaoke companies, there are gazillions of songs still lacking their karaoke versions. Isn't it a cool thing to find something that hasn't been done and create karaoke versions for everyone to sing. Think about it! And remember to contact us once you have something ready!
