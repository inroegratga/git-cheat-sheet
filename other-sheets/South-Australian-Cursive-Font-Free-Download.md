The unjoined form of the South Australian style is **SA Beginner GT**. The transitional **SA PreCursive GT** is also unjoined but the letters have cursive entries and exits which the writer needs to master as they move towards fully joined writing.

The weight of the Regular fonts is intended to match the average pen thickness of the illustrations in **Handwriting in the South Australian Curriculum 2nd Edition**. The Thick weight is approximately 170% of the Regular weight as per common typographic practice.
 
The **SA Beginner GT** fonts are available as Regular (with and without directional arrows), OutIined (with and without directional arrows), Dotted (with and without directional arrows) and Thick. The **SA PreCursive GT** fonts are available as Regular, Thick and OutIined. These 10 fonts plus PDF Manual comprises the Beginner Pack.
 
When fully joined, the PreCursive becomes the South Australian Modern Cursive style. The automatically-joining fully cursive font **SA Cursive GT Pro** is available as a separate package with its own Manual. The **SA Cursive GT Pro** font is supplied in one weight which is slightly thinner than the stand-alone **SA Beginner GT-Regular** and **SA PreCursive GT-Regular** fonts to reflect the fact that, by the time the student begins cursive writing, they will be probably be using more refined writing implements such as ball-point pens etc. Also, the lighter weight allows the cursive joins to be displayed more accurately and clearly. There are no Thick, Outlined, Dotted or Directional Arrow versions in the **SA Cursive GT Pro** font.
 
The **SA Beginner GT**, **SA PreCursive GT** and **SA Cursive GT Pro** fonts slope to the right at an angle of 6 to the vertical - see page 23 of **Handwriting in the South Australian Curriculum 2nd Edition**. The fonts can be slightly skewed in either direction to achieve other slopes if preferred.

The default numbers for the South Australian style are uppercase-height as recommended in **Handwriting in the South Australian Curriculum 2nd Edition**. In addition to uppercase-height numbers, alternate threequarter-height numbers (and corresponding mathematical symbols) are supplied in all fonts. Note that in the original 1983/1996 syllabus publication, the recommended size for numbers was threequarter-height. A special OpenType feature makes it easy to switch between the two different number sizes.

The **SA Tight Text GT Pack** is a 4-font OpenType family (Regular, Italic, Bold, Bold Italic) in the SA style, optimised for use in text with normal linespacing. The Italics are based on the PreCursive letterforms. The height of the capital letters as well as the length of the ascenders (b, d, f, h, k, l, t) and descenders (f, g, j, p, q, y, z) have all been reduced, making normal linespacing possible. The fonts have similar proportions, size and linespacing to normal text fonts (eg Arial, Helvetica etc) at the same point size. Ideal for school newsletters, pupil's reports, worksheets, forms, websites and documents, allowing them to be written in the same recognisable style that the students are learning to write - but avoiding the very wide linespacing that you would get if you were to use our Beginner teaching fonts. Multi-Language support - contains all special characters required for Australian Aboriginal, NZ Maori, Classical Latin (Phonetic) and many other commonly-taught languages which use the latin alphabet. Enhanced Maths support, with the ability to type "true" fractions automatically. Includes Special custom Keyboard Layout software (Mac & Windows) for use with Australian Aboriginal and Phonetic Latin (Note - Keyboard Layouts for all the other languages are already standard with the Mac and Windows operating systems). Note these fonts don't include horizontal guidelines. Numbers are cap-height by default. Not available as individual fonts. Delivered by download. 10-computer licence. Win/Mac compatible. The **SA Tight Text GT** fonts are NOT recommended for use by pupils in the very early handwriting teaching stages.
 
For dyslexic children, they may have problems with forming their letters correctly while writing, e.g. starting from the bottom of the letter instead of the top. Some may get mixed up with b and d. (See the resource to help children remember them). Children can also practise forming the letters and linking them in sand in a tray or shaving cream on a table. This makes it fun at the same time.
 
Learning to draw and write for young children is essential in the development of their handwriting. Children move through different developmental stages of holding a pencil and experiment with writing at their own rate. Some children may start to write letters or their name, but there is no set standard for where children should be with their writing because every child is different. The parent guide for South Australia is a good resource for more information for parents about handwriting.
 
When children first go to school, they practise learning to hold a pencil correctly and to sit with the correct posture. They learn how to form the letters and numbers correctly. This also helps them learn to write the letters the same size and then on lines. As they get older, they are taught to link the letters together to form cursive writing.
 
They can also practise tracing different lines, as this helps them with their fine motor skills (their writing and drawing). Other activities that are good in developing fine motor skills in children are cutting, painting, threading, drawing, puzzles or Lego construction. Children can develop their coordination and strength by playing sports or games or going to the playground. All these skills assist them in them learning to write.
 
When learning to read, children first have to link the shape of the word on the page with the sound it makes. Then, when it comes to writing, they have to recreate that shape back onto paper. For children with dyslexia, decoding these patterns and making these links can often be very difficult. As a result, they frequently fail to develop the automatic flow of writing which will help them to express themselves clearly and easily in writing.
 
If you wish to practise handwriting with your child, it is advisable to use a recommended teaching resource. This will show you exactly how to form the letters and how best to practise them. It is also worth paying attention to a few basics, such as:
 
Some pupils with dyslexia and related conditions such as dyspraxia find that the difficulties associated with handwriting can inhibit their ability to structure and write a piece of work. The handwriting itself can take up too much concentration and effort.
 
The font design in our books aims to support handwriting as taught by Australian schools. The font also improves legibility and readability of letters and words thereby making communication and improves easy to remember and recall for the student.
 
During the Korean War, No. 77 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) had a diverse range of nose art on their Mustangs and Meteor aircraft. From rank emblems and names applied in cursive red font to more ornate artworks including cartoons and sporting emblems, the unit continued the tradition of applying nose art to wartime Australian military aircraft.

**Cursive** (also known as **joined-up writing**[1][2]) is any style of penmanship in which characters are written joined in a flowing manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster, in contrast to block letters. It varies in functionality and modern-day usage across languages and regions; being used both publicly in artistic and formal documents as well as in private communication. Formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. The writing style can be further divided as "looped", "italic", or "connected".
 
The cursive method is used with many alphabets due to infrequent pen lifting and beliefs that it increases writing speed. Despite this belief, more elaborate or ornamental styles of writing can be slower to reproduce. In some alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected, sometimes making a word one single complex stroke.
 
Cursive is a style of penmanship in which the symbols of the language are written in a conjoined and/or *flowing* manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster. This writing style is distinct from "print-script" using block letters, in which the letters of a word are unconnected and in Roman/Gothic letterform rather than joined-up script. Not all cursive copybooks join all letters; formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. In the Arabic, Syriac, Latin, and Cyrillic alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected (while others must not), sometimes making a word one single complex stroke. In Hebrew cursive and Roman cursive, the letters are not connected. In Maharashtra, there was a cursive alphabet, known as t
