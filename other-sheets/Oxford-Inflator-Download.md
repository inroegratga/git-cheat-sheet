The famous Sonnox Oxford Inflator I am using in every production on nearly every Channel! It is my secret weapon since 2002! I own it for the Powercore, Native and now for the UAD2. Why? Because I can! :-) No... Seriously: On Garage-Band it works only with the UAD2 Version. That's why!

When I tried to install the Oxford inflator into Pro Tools, it wouldn't accept it because it was 32 bit instead of the current minimum 64 bit. I give it two stars instead of one because if it was able to be installed, it might have been a helpful plugin.
 
They both have the ability to add harmonics to the signal coming into them, so I started there. Odd harmonics are usually associated with transformers and even harmonics with tubes. I wanted to see what each of these Sonnox products produced. The input signal was at -6dB and is the first order or fundamental, represented by the pink horizontal line in the graphs below.
 
2. With the effect in and at 100% and the curve at 17.0, you can see the odd harmonics in the -15dB to -20dB range (yellow and green lines), while the even harmonics have a different signature showing some peaks in the midrange and tapering upward at either end (green, orange, and brown lines).
 
Since the inflator is giving a lot of harmonics and doing the best at sweetening the sound for me, I try to never use the enhance feature of the limiter as it only adds, what I feel, are conflicting harmonics, making my sound a bit muddier.
