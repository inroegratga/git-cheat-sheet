Many of our customers, however, use FPGAs also in a different context, namely for designing ASICs, which is a highly specialized market that typically involves large FPGAs, proprietary flows and IP. In one such project, we were working with one of the largest FPGAs in production today, the 9-million LUT Xilinx VU19. Being a design with considerable complexity, it needed a high-throughput link between the FPGA and the host PC that could be thoroughly benchmarked, analyzed and optimized for the use case.
 
Implementing PCIe is not completely straightforward as you have to synchronize multiple lines of high-speed bi-directional data. If you hit a bug somewhere in your data flow, things get very tricky to debug, especially if you have no ability to inspect and change the source code of the IPs involved. Being active developers of a variety of portable and reusable open source FPGA IP cores, for the project in question we were able to integrate a fully open PCIe interface into the Xilinx VU19-based ASIC prototyping platform using LiteX/LitePCIe, achieving a pretty respectable throughput of 31 Gbits/s on an 8-lane bandwidth. Although the FPGA chip itself is capable of 16-lane bandwidth for transferring data, the proFPGA board used in the setup supports only 8 lanes, but with hardware capable of bigger bandwidth we can achieve even greater throughput if needed. In fact, the repository also contains instructions for a 16-lane capable VU9-based setup - using a popular and not as prohibitively expensive devboard available from after-market- where we could measure as much as 59 Gbits/s.

The PCIe core used in the ASIC prototyping project also works great in sophisticated computer systems we have been building for our customers. The wide array of customizable and licence-free FPGA IPs and SoC generators that we work with allows us to implement specific functionalities in the devices we build and it includes MIPI CSI and other camera interfaces, SDI, HDMI, ISP processing, video codecs, AI and 2D GPU acceleration, I2S, SPDIF, PCIe, USB, Ethernet, DMA, SATA and DRAM controllers.
 
Our customers have full control over the solutions we build for them thanks to the open and vendor-neutral nature of the solutions we work with. If you are looking to build an FPGA or ASIC system that you truly own and understand, make sure to get in touch with us at contact@antmicro.com to hire our development services.
 
Xilinx Runtime library (XRT) is a key component of Vitis Unified Software Platform and Vitis AI Development Environment, that enables developers to deploy on AMD adaptable platforms, while continuing to use familiar programming languages like C/C++, Python and high-level domain-specific frameworks like TensorFlow and Caffe.
 
Xilinx Runtime library (XRT) is an open-source standardized software interface that facilitates communication between the application code and the accelerated-kernels deployed on the reconfigurable portion of PCIe based Alveo accelerator cards, Zynq 7000, Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC based embedded platforms or Versal ACAPs.
 
Xilinx Runtime Library (XRT) runs on the Host CPU. In the case of Embedded Platforms, the Host refers to the ARM processor on the AMD platform and in the case of Alveo Accelerator cards, it refers to the x86-based CPU or Power PC CPU on the server.
 
Using the Python language, Jupyter notebooks, and the huge ecosystem of Python libraries, designers can exploit the benefits of programmable logic and microprocessors to build more capable and exciting electronic systems.

PYNQ can be delivered in two ways; as a bootable Linux image for a Zynq board, which includes the pynq Python package, and other open-source packages, or as a Python package for Kria, or an Alveo or AWS-F1 host computer. Find out about PYNQ supported boards.
 
Jupyter Notebook is a browser based interactive computing environment. Jupyter notebook documents can be created that include live code, interactive widgets, plots, explanatory text, equations, images and video.
 
Using Python, developers can use hardware libraries and overlays on the programmable logic. Hardware libraries, or overlays, can speed up software running on a Zynq or Alveo board, and customize the hardware platform and interfaces.
 
I'm looking for an open source verilog synthesizer. I am using Icarus Verilog as a verilog simulator. Originally I was going to use it for both simulation and synthesis, but found out the tool no longer supports synthesis. I have found the gEDA website and I have looked around there, but was not able to find a replacement synthesizer.
 
Also, if you could shed some light on the process from going from Verilog to FPGA that would be great. I feel as though there are more steps in the process from going from Verilog to FPGA than just simulation and then synthesis.
 
Synthesis is highly dependent on the platform you're using and usually needs to be done by tools created by Altera, Xilinx, etc. Nothing open source exists (AFAIK) because this is so custom and requires a lot of effort to obtain optimal and correct results. Therefore, there's little incentive to do open source. Also, because of the IP, these companies don't share information about their chip internals, which prevents others from using them without going through the manufacturers.
 
By the way, Altera and Xilinx (perhaps others) provide free versions of their tools with some features missing you can use (which is another reason no one seems to do anything open source). They're good enough for many projects.
 
So, to summarize, do you think anyone would spend time, for no money, to create something that is difficult, with little information, when the manufacturer already provides some of it for free? Take a look at the open source BIOS for PCs. Hasn't gone very far for these same reasons.
 
There are no open source synthesizers. People (and especially enthusiast) stick with vendor tools. Given that Papillo comes with Xilinx Spartan 3E FPGA, you can use Xilinx's ISE WebPACK, which is free.
 
Based on a stack architecture, Vitis starts with a target platform featuring a board and preprogrammed input/output (IO); this is followed by the Vitis Core Development Kit, which is made up of the Xilinx open-source runtime library and development tools including compilers, analysers, and debuggers; the third layer is made up of eight libraries with more than 400 open-source applications, all of which are accelerated on the FPGA and can be called via a standard application programming interface (API).
 
The framework was originally developed in the context of securing consumer-facing devices, using off-the-shelf Digilent Arty (DDR3, Xilinx Series7 FPGA) and Xilinx ZCU104 (DDR4, Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGA) boards, then followed by a dedicated open hardware board from Antmicro that allowed work on custom LPDDR4 modules. The framework has since helped discover a new attack method named Blacksmith and continues to provide valuable insights into how the security of both edge device and data center memory can be improved.
 
To extend the Rowhammer tester support from consumer-facing devices to shared-compute data center infrastructure, Antmicro developed the data center DRAM tester board. We adapted this open source hardware-test platform from the original LPDDR4 board to enable Rowhammer and other memory security experiments with DDR4 RDIMMs using a fully configurable, open source FPGA-based DDR controller.
 
The Data Center DRAM Tester board design has now been upgraded into revision 1.2, which brings new features for implementing even more complex DRAM testing scenarios. The 1.2 boards support a Power over Ethernet (PoE) supply option so the board can act as a standalone network device with data exchange and power-cycling done over a single Ethernet cable. This simplifies integration of the board in DRAM testing clusters and custom runners capable of doing hardware-in-the-loop testing.
 
The new revision of the board will support hot-swapping of the DRAM module under test, which should speed up testing of multiple DRAM modules without the need to power-cycle the tester. Finally, the new revision of the board will include power-measurement circuitry so it will be possible to compare the peak and average power consumption of DRAM while working with different DRAM refresh scenarios.
 
Xilinx is known for high-performance FPGAs. The company delivered impressive development tools for hardware and software that takes advantage of its FPGA and SoC platforms, such as the Vivado Design Suite and SDSoC environment. Its Versal Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) incorporates artificial-intelligence (AI) acceleration.
 
Vitis is an open-source platform that includes open-source libraries and runtimes optimized for conventional CPU and GPU platforms as well as Xilinx FPGA and SoC hardware. It features libraries like the OpenCV video processing library, the BLAS (basic linear algebra subprograms) library, a finance library, the Vitis Video library based on FFMEG, and a TensorFlow Vitis AI library. It also supports third-party libraries such as GTAK genomic and data-analytic tools. These domain-specific architecture (DSA) libraries have become popular among designers.
 
The company has provided a development environment, but Vitis tools are designed to work with existing development platforms like Visual Studio Code and Eclipse. The tools are mostly command-line applications that a
