
Wahai para manusia ikan(dibaca:pelaut), taukah Engkau bahwa sesungguhnya kemerdekaan itu ialah hak segala bangsa? Kalau tau bagus sekali berarti kita bisa lanjut langsung ke topik ini.P2TL atau Peraturan Pencegahan Tubrukan di Laut atau istilah internasionalnya adalah COLREG bukan KOREK yah, biasanya pelaut seneng ama yg dikorek2, korek kuping maksudnya. Nah kali ini gua akan share peraturan-peraturan di *Collision Regulations.*Eittss, sebelum itu uda pada tau gak? Kalo COLREG kini ada 41 aturan, dan uda tau gak? Kalo kulit manggis kini ada ekstraknya. Gua juga baru tau belakangan ini tepatnya sehari sebelum persiapan tes interview dengan salah satu perusahan *gas carrier*asing, dan lu bisa bayangin kan perasaan gua yg lagi pengen inget-inget sambil ngehafalin COLREG sewaktu tau aturannya malah nambah, gua bener-bener gak terima semua itu, gua ngerasa hidup ini gak adil, sampai pada akhirnya gua makan nutrijel dan makanan yg berserat, alhasil BAB gua jadi lancar. Oke daripada makin melebar pembicara kita ke arah yang kurang jelas mari kita mulai saja yah Bro, Bri dan Bray sekalian. *Check it out Dude!!*
*Note: Jika ingin melihat salah satu aturan saja silahkan bisa langsung klik judul yg di highlight*

Part A - General 
Rule 1Application(a)These Rules shall apply to all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels.
(b)Nothing in these Rules shall interfere in the operation of special rules made by an appropriate authority for roadsteads, harbors, rivers, lakes or inland waterways connected with the high seas and navigable by seagoing vessels. Such special rules shall conform as closely as possible to these Rules.
(c) Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of any special rules made by the Government of any State with respect to additional station or signal lights or shapes or whistle signals for ships of war and vessels proceeding under convoy, or with respect to additional station or signal lights for fishing vessels fishing as a fleet. These additional station or signal lights or whistle signals shall, so far as possible, be such that they cannot be mistaken for any light, shape, or signal authorized elsewhere under these Rules.
(d) Traffic separation schemes may be adopted by the Organization for the purpose of these Rules.
(e) Whenever the Government concerned shall have determined that a vessel of special construction or purpose cannot comply fully with the provisions of any of these Rules with respect to number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, such vessel shall comply with such other provisions in regard to number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, as her Government shall have determined to be the closest possible compliance with these Rules in respect to that vessel.
 
Rule 2Responsibility(a) Nothing in these Rules shall exonerate any vessel, or the owner, master, or crew thereof, from the consequences of any neglect to comply with these Rules or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen, or by the special circumstances of the case.
(b) In construing and complying with these Rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision and to any special circumstances, including the limitations of the vessels involved, which may make a departure from these Rules necessary to avoid immediate danger.
 
Rule 3General DefinitionsFor the purpose of these Rules, except where the context otherwise requires: 
(a) The word "vessel" includes every description of water craft, including nondisplacement craft, WIG craft and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.
(b) The term "power driven vessel" means any vessel propelled by machinery.
(c) The term "sailing vessel" means any vessel under sail provided that propelling machinery, if fitted, is not being used.
(d) The term "vessel engaged in fishing" means any vessel fishing with nets, lines, trawls, or other fishing apparatus which restrict maneuverability, but does not include a vessel fishing with trolling lines or other fishing apparatus which do not restrict manageability.
(e) The term "seaplane" includes any aircraft designed to maneuver on the water.
(f) The term "vessel not under command" means a vessel which through some exceptional circumstance is unable to maneuver as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel.
(g) The term "vessel restricted in her ability to maneuver" means a vessel which from the nature of her work is restricted in her ability to maneuver as required by these Rules and is therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel. 
The term "vessel restricted in her ability to maneuver" shall include but not be limited to: 

- (i) A vessel engaged in laying, servicing, or picking up a navigational mark, submarine cable or pipeline;
- (ii) A vessel engaged in dredging, surveying or underwater operations;
- (iii) A vessel engaged in replenishment or transferring persons, provisions or cargo while underway;
- (iv) A vessel engaged in the launching or recovery of aircraft;
- (v) A vessel engaged in mineclearance operations;
- (vi) A vessel engaged in a towing operation such as severely restricts the towing vessel and her tow in their ability to deviate from their course.

(h) The term "vessel constrained by her draft" means a power-driven vessel which because of her draft in relation to the available depth and width of navigable water is severely restricted in her ability to deviate from the course she is following.
(i) The word "underway" means a vessel is not at anchor, or made fast to the shore, or aground.
(j) The words "length" and "breadth" of a vessel mean her length overall and greatest breadth.
(k) Vessels shall be deemed to be in sight of one another only when one can be observed visually from the other.
(l) The term "restricted visibility" means any condition in which visibility is restricted by fog, mist, falling snow, heavy rainstorms, sandstorms and any other similar causes.
(m) The term "Wing-In-Ground (WIG) craft" means a multimodal craft which, in its main operational mode, flies in close proximity to the surface by utilizing surface-effect action. 
Part B - Steering and Sailing Rules
Section I - Conduct of Vessels in any Condition of Visibility 
Rule 4ApplicationRules in this section apply to any condition of visibility.
 
Rule 5Look-outEvery vessel shall at all times maintain a proper look-out by sight as well as by hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision.
 
Rule 6Safe SpeedEvery vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions. 
In determining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken into account:
(a)By all vessels:

- (i)The state of visibility;
- (ii) The traffic density including concentrations of fishing vessels or any other vessels;
- (iii) The manageability of the vessel with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions;
- (iv) At night the presence of background light such as from shore lights or from back scatter from her own lights;
- (v) The state of wind, sea and current, and the proximity of navigational hazards;
- (vi) The draft in relation to the available depth of water.

(b) Additionally, by vessels with operational radar: 

- (i) The characteristics, efficiency and limitations of the radar equipment;
- (ii) Any constrains imposed by the rada
