Flexible records were commercially introduced as the **Eva-tone Soundsheet** in 1962.[1][2] They were very popular among children and teenagers and mass-produced by the state publisher in the Soviet government.[*citation needed*]
 
Before the advent of the compact disc, flexi discs were sometimes used as a means to include sound with printed material such as magazines and music instruction books.[3] A flexi disc could be moulded with speech or music and bound into the text with a perforated seam, at very little cost and without any requirement for a hard binding.[4] One problem with using the thinner vinyl was that the stylus's weight, combined with the flexi disc's low mass, would sometimes cause the disc to stop spinning on the turntable and become held in place by the stylus.[3] For this reason, most flexi discs had a spot on the face of the disc for a coin, or other small, flat, weighted object to increase the friction with the turntable surface and enforce consistent rotation. If the turntable's surface is not completely flat, it is recommended that the flexi disc be placed on top of a full sized record.[5]
 
Every year between 1963 and 1969, the Beatles made a special Christmas recording which was made into a flexi disc and sent to members of their fan club. While the earlier discs largely contained 'thank you' messages to their fans, the later Christmas flexis were used as an outlet for the Beatles to explore more experimental areas; the 1967 disc, for example, became a pastiche of a BBC Radio show and even included a specially recorded song entitled "Christmas Time (Is Here Again)."[7]
 
In 1964, the National Geographic Society released *Song and Garden Birds of North America*, which included a 6 sound discs (12-sides) bound alternating with pages giving the titles and birds on the recordings.[8] The work was done by Arthur A.

Excerpts from various recordings of Churchill's speeches are included. The recording ends with bagpipes accompanying Churchill's coffin to the funeral barge on the Thames, as the public phase of the funeral ends.[9]
 
During the 1970s, *MAD* magazine included Soundsheets in several special editions. One was a dramatization of *Gall in the Family Fare*, its parody of *All in the Family,* packaged with *MAD Super Special*#11 (1973). The Summer 1980 edition of *MAD Super Special* (published in 1979) featured "It's a Super-Spectacular Day", a song with eight different versions pressed into eight concentric grooves; which version was played depended on where the needle was dropped onto the disc. Another issue included "It's a Gas", a song whose lyrics were belches.[10][11] There was also a "Mad Disco" special issue containing a Soundsheet.

Computer magazines began to provide software in audio form "Vinyl Data" on flexi discs from June 1979 until 1986, as an alternative to a reader manually typing in a printed program code listing. They were intended to be dubbed by the user into cassette tape recorder, which can be played by the computer's tape drive to load the program.[12]
 
While flexi-discs were usually just used as occasional giveaways, from 1980 to 1982, *Flexipop* made a speciality of giving away such a disc with each edition.

In November 2010 extreme metal magazine *Decibel* began releasing flexi discs with each issue, starting with the January 2011 issue. The content on the disc features "100 percent exclusive songs" from artists that have been previously featured in the publication.[15][16]
