An acoustic neuroma (also known as a vestibular schwannoma) its a benign tumor originating from the nerve sheath of cranial nerve VIII, which may affect both the cochlear and vestibular branches, with auditory and equilibrium implications.
 
On imaging, they classically present as a solid nodular mass with an intracanalicular component that often results in widening of the porus acusticus. They usually show intense contrast enhancement and, when larger, cystic degeneration can be present. Hemorrhagic areas may also be seen, but calcification is typically not present.

**Vestibular schwannomas** are commonly known as **acoustic neuromas**, which is a misnomer. The term vestibular schwannoma is preferred as these tumors most frequently arise from the vestibular portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve and arise from Schwann cells 13. A mixture of the terms, **acoustic schwannoma**, may also be seen.
 
Although they usually occur between the fourth to sixth decades of life, with a median age of 50 years 11, individuals with NF2 tend to present earlier, with a peak incidence around the third decade of life ref. Although rare, vestibular schwannomas may occur in children ref.
 
The typical presentation is with adult-onset sensorineural hearing loss or non-pulsatile tinnitus. In some patients, this goes unnoticed, and presentation is delayed until the lesion is much larger and presents with symptoms related to mass effect. Possibilities include cerebellar and brainstem symptoms (e.g. cranial nerve dysfunction, other than vestibulocochlear), or hydrocephalus due to effacement of the fourth ventricle.
 
Vestibular schwannomas are benign tumors (WHO grade 1), which usually arise from the intracanalicular segment of the vestibular portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) 2,4. They were classically described as originating near the transition zone between glial and Schwann cells but contemporary data suggests they can originate at any point along the nerve 8,16,17. In over 90% of cases, these tumors arise from the inferior division of the vestibular nerve 8. Less than 5% cases arise from the cochlear component of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) 13.
 
a small "CSF cap" typically remains, separating intracanalicular tumor from the cochlea; however, growth laterally through the cochlea (transmodiolar) or vestibule (transmacular) into the middle ear may occasionally occur
 
May show erosion and widening of the internal acoustic canal (IAC). The density of these tumors on non-contrast imaging is variable, and often they are hard to see, especially on account of beam hardening and streak artifact from the adjacent petrous temporal bone.
 
Contrast enhancement is present but can be underwhelming, especially in larger lesions with cystic components. Many cysts are loculations of CSF adjacent to a vestibular schwannoma, others represent cystic degeneration within schwannomas.

usually more homogeneous in appearance: significant signal heterogeneity with cystic or hemorrhagic areas is more typical of vestibular schwannomas than meningiomas (although cystic meningiomas do occur)
 
An acoustic neuroma is often hard to diagnose in the early stages because symptoms may be easy to miss and develop slowly over time. Common symptoms such as hearing loss also are associated with many other middle and inner ear problems.
 
**Hearing test, known as audiometry.** This test is conducted by a hearing specialist called an audiologist. During the test, sounds are directed to one ear at a time. The audiologist presents a range of sounds of various tones. You indicate each time you hear the sound. Each tone is repeated at faint levels to find out when you can barely hear.
 
You and your health care team may decide to monitor an acoustic neuroma if it's small and isn't growing or if it's growing slowly. This may be an option if the acoustic neuroma causes few or no symptoms. Monitoring also may be recommended if you're an older adult or if you're not a good candidate for more-aggressive treatment.
 
While being monitored, you'll need regular imaging and hearing tests, usually every 6 to 12 months. These tests can determine whether the tumor is growing and how quickly. If the scans show the tumor is growing or if the tumor causes worse symptoms or other problems, you may need to have surgery or radiation.
 
The goal of surgery is to remove the tumor and preserve the facial nerve to prevent paralysis of muscles in your face. Removing the entire tumor may not always be possible. For example, if the tumor is too close to important parts of the brain or the facial nerve, only part of the tumor may be removed.
 
Sometimes removing the tumor may worsen symptoms if the hearing, balance, or facial nerves are irritated or damaged during the operation. Hearing may be lost on the side where the surgery is performed. Balance is usually affected temporarily.
 
Stereotactic radiosurgery, such as Gamma Knife and CyberKnife, uses many tiny gamma rays to deliver a precisely targeted dose of radiation to a tumor. This technique offers treatment without damaging the surrounding tissue or making an incision.
 
In addition to treatment to remove or stop the growth of the tumor, supportive therapies can help. Supportive therapies address symptoms or complications of an acoustic neuroma and its treatment, such as dizziness or balance problems.

**Maintain a strong support system.** Family and friends can help you as you go through this challenging time. Sometimes, though, you may find the concern and understanding of other people with an acoustic neuroma especially comforting.
 
You first may see a health care professional. This person may refer you to a doctor trained in ear, nose and throat conditions. Or you may be referred to a doctor trained in brain and nervous system surgery, known as a neurosurgeon.
 
An acoustic neuroma, also known as a vestibular schwannoma, is a noncancerous tumor. It develops on the balance nerve, known as the vestibular nerve, and on the auditory nerve, known as the cochlear nerve. These nerves lead from your inner ear to the brain, as shown in the top image. The pressure on the nerve from the tumor may cause hearing loss and imbalance. In some cases, the tumor may grow and affect the cerebellum or other brain tissues, as shown in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and illustrations above.
 
An acoustic schwannoma is a relatively common type of tumor which arises from the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII). Acoustic neuromas containing cystic parts are fairly common, but it is rare to be mainly composed of cysts.
 
An acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor that develops on the nerve that connects the ear to the brain. The tumor usually grows slowly. As it grows, it presses against the hearing and balance nerves. At first, you may have no symptoms or mild symptoms. They can include:
 
Well-defined extra-axial right cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern mass extending into the internal auditory canal, which shows low signal on T1 weighted images and heterogenous hyperintensity in T2 weighted images. After contrast administration, the mass show intense contrast enhancement. No diffusion restriction of mass. The mass gives the appearance of ice cream cone, intracanalicular component representing the cone and CPA cisternal component the ice cream ball.
 
Vestibular schwannoma is also known as acoustic neuroma. It refers to a benign schwannoma of 8th cranial nerve which accounts for about 8% to 10% of all intracranial tumors and about 80% of cerebellopontine angle tumors. It arises from the vestibular division of the nerve. Acoustic neuroma is a slow growing tumor that arise from the nerve sheath and consist of schwannoma cells in collagenous matrix. They usually arise in the within the internal auditory canal, but they occasionally develop in the cerebellopontine angle medial to the porus acusticus. They are usually unilateral and are non-heritable.
 
MRI demonstrates a solid heterogeneous tumor at the left cerebellopontine angle, enlarging and partially occupying the left internal acoustic canal, exhibiting vivid contrast enhancement and mass effect over the adjacent cerebellar peduncle and pons. The fourth ventricle is partially effaced, however there is no obstructive hydrocephalus.
 
Marked enlargement of the left internal auditory canal presumably due to the presence of an acoustic neuroma, although no soft tissue windows have been performed. Cochlea and bony labyrinth are intact. Middle ear structures are normal.
 
Pneumocephalus has almost resolved. Most of the mastoid has been resected on the left but fluid fills remaining mastoid air cells. Opacification of the left middle ear cavity has been present since the post-operative CT brain.
