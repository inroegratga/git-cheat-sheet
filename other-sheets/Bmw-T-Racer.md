Most adult North American Racers are about 20-56 inches (50-142 cm) in total length. This is a long and slender snake with large and prominent eyes. Adults are black or bluish/black with white or whitish markings on the chin and throat. Juveniles are gray with distinct reddish-brown blotches running down the back of the head and body.

**Non-Venomous.** North American racers are not dangerous to people or pets, but they will readily bite to defend themselves. Racers are not aggressive and avoid direct contact with people and pets. Virtually all bites occur when the snakes are intentionally molested.
 
Most adult North American Racers are about 20-56 inches (50-142 cm) in total length, with a record length recorded of 72 inches (182 cm). This is a long and slender snake with smooth scales in 17 dorsal rows at midbody. Adults are black or bluish/black with white or brown and white markings on the chin and throat. The belly is grayish to black and without any markings. The head is only slightly distinct from the neck. The pupil is round, and the eyes are large and prominent. Juveniles are gray with distinct reddish-brown blotches running down the back of the head and body that gradually fade into a solid-colored tail. The juvenile pattern gradually changes to the adult pattern and is completely replaced after about two years.

North American Racers occupy a wide variety of habitats, such as pine flatwoods, hardwood hammocks, prairies, sandhills, scrub, cypress strands, melaleuca forests, and limestone outcroppings. Adults and juveniles of this species are often found in suburban neighborhoods where development encroaches into favorable habitats.
 
When approached, racers will typically flee for shelter, relying on speed and agility to avoid capture. However, if they are cornered, both juveniles and adults will strike at the attacker and rapidly vibrate the tip of the tail, which produces a buzzing sound in leaf litter. If grabbed or pinned, they will readily bite the attacker. Nonetheless, these snakes are not aggressive, and striking is only used in defense as a last resort.
 
North American Racers are opportunistic and diurnal predators with a diet as varied as their choice of habitat. They are known to feed on small mammals, birds and their eggs, lizards, turtles, snakes, frogs, salamanders, fishes, insects and spiders. In Florida, frogs, lizards, and small snakes make up the majority of their diet. Despite their scientific name (Coluber constrictor), racers are not true constrictors and overpower their prey by simply grabbing it in their jaws and pressing it against the ground until it stops struggling or by quickly swallowing it alive.
 
North American Racers are one of the snakes most commonly seen by Floridians. These snakes inhabit both rural and urban habitats and are frequently seen in residential areas during the daytime. These are fast, agile, and heat-loving snakes with keen eyesight. They can often be seen crawling with their head and neck raised above the ground as they scan their environment.
 
Juvenile North American Racers are often mistaken for pygmy rattlesnakes. Juvenile racers are long and pencil thin, whereas pygmy rattlesnakes are much thicker for their length. As always, if you are not 100% positive of the identification of a snake, it is best for everyone involved to leave it alone.

**RUNNING SHOE SUMMARY**

The Altra Escalante Racer 2 is Altra's lowest stack shoe, designed for faster training and racing. Altra says the main update to the shoe is a new engineered mesh upper, keeping the 22mm stack height, Altra Ego midsole, Original FootShape toe box (Altra's widest), and zero drop the same as version 1. Strangely, according to Altra's website, the women's version has gained 0.7 oz over version 1 and the men's has gained 2.0 oz, with the men's version 2 weighing 8.8oz and women's 6.4oz. Version 2 has a much stiffer platform than v1, with a noticeable lack of forefoot flexibility that completely changed the ride of the shoe for me (Andrea), decreasing its performance at faster paces for me. The Altra Escalante 2 is a neutral, zero drop, stiff shoe that performs differently from its more flexible, lighter-weight predecessor.

**FIT**
*(To learn how a shoe should fit, check out our **full podcast on fit** by Matt Klein.)*

*Matt:*The Altra Escalante Racer 2 fits me true to size, if a tiny bit long in my normal men's US size 10. The overall fit is normal to slightly snug with the exception of the wide forefoot/toebox. The volume is lower except for the forefoot, which has a little wiggle room height wise thanks to the thin, slightly flexible upper. The toe box is wide and rounded with plenty of room for toe splay. The midfoot tapers quickly to a normal to slightly snug fit. The tongue is thin and non-gusseted. I had some mild sliding of the tongue, so securing the laces and not turning quickly is important. The heel features mild heel collar cushioning with a small, flexible heel counter. The heel did not bother me at all and those with sensitivities should be completely. The upper is a thin engineered mesh that has some stretch to it. I found the security fine when running in a straight line with the laces locked down. It was not secure with turning as my foot slid within despite locking down the upper. I would encourage socks as the inner aspect of the upper is a little scratchy. It is well-ventilated, so those with tougher feet than I may be able to handle sockless running.

*Andrea:*The Altra Escalante Racer 2 fits true to size in my usual women's 9.5. I have a full thumb's width from the front of my big toe to the end of the shoe and the Original FootShape fit toe box is wide enough, but doesn't feel too wide for a performance shoe. I wish I had kept my pair of original Escalante Racers, but it seems to me that the upper of v2 has a little more structure than v1, which provides a comfortable and secure fit. There are sections of the mesh that have larger perforations (over the toes and the medial midfoot) and other sections that have a tighter mesh (dorsum of foot, all of the rearfoot, and lateral midfoot, which is also reinforced with a large Altra logo). I like the upper and think that Altra did a good job of providing structure without making the upper overly stiff. The midfoot and rearfoot are normal width and the shoe fit securely, without having to crank down the laces. The thin, non-gusseted tongue has large perforations and is held in place by a lace loop. The upper is quite breathable, which I have appreciated on some warmer runs. There is a small, semi-rigid heel counter that has a small amount of padding. I was quite pleased with the overall fit of the shoe and find the thin mesh upper to be well-suited to a performance trainer.

**PERFORMANCE**

*Matt:*The Altra Escalante Racer 2 is a lighter performance trainer/lightweight lower/moderate stack height trainer. True to Altra, the sole is **zero drop**. This is noticeable and those interested in those shoe should have adequate ankle mobility and calf strength. The stack height is also noticeable lower. It is not a full minimal shoe, but is definitely lower stack height by today's standards. The midsole is on the stiffer side for such low riding shoe, but is slightly firmer as expected. The Altra Ego midsole has some resiliency and responsiveness when the pace picks up, but this is a more traditional shoe where your body is doing the work. The higher weight for a "racer" is noticeable. My size 10 weighs 8.8 oz, almost 1.5 oz heavier than the same size of my original pair of Escalante Racers. This makes this shoe feel more comfortable as a lower stack height training tool for shorter miles and for shorter workouts on road and the track. It is not a shoe I would use for longer distances as it is too firm and does not have any modern day racing shoe qualities. 

Transition-wise, the heel features a small bevel that combined with the lower stack provides a normal landing. This transitions into a slightly stiff midfoot. This then goes into a stiffer forefoot. There is no plate in this shoe but I noticed the stiffer forefoot immediately. This was surprising to me due to the "inner flex grooves", but I think it was a little extra stiff also due to the slightly long fit for me. Regardless, the slightly stiffer ride did make this a better shoe for shorter and faster miles. However, the higher weight limited this shoe from really feel good/faster on speedy efforts. I found it best for moderate-to-uptempo paces and during fartlek-type efforts. The durability is fairly good and typical for a lightweight trainer. I have 20 miles on my pair with only minimal wear in the heel and slightly more accelerated
