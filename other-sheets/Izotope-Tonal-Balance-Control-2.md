Drawn from analysis of decades of recorded audio across the spectrum of styles and genres, Tonal Balance Control 2 offers a set of 12 target curves that help give you fix balance issues in your sound, even in poor listening environments. Whether your style calls for massive low-end or brilliant highs, you'll always have a benchmark with genre curves from "rock" to "reggae" and more.
 
Load your own reference track to generate a unique curve: see the balance of your favourite songs, and fine-tune your master to match their sound. Use the target curves to keep your music on track and help it translate to your audience!

If you have Neutron 3 or Ozone 9 in your session, you can open their EQs from Tonal Balance Control 2 and make finer tonal adjustments to your individual tracks or master. Combine the power of iZotope tools and bring your session together to speed up your mixing and mastering workflow!
 
Relay is included in Tonal Balance Control 2 and goes on your individual tracks, acting as a mini-channel strip complete with gain, pan, high pass, and even stereo width controls. Relay also talks to other iZotope plug-ins, enabling machine-learning features to help you remove masking, bring balance and focus your mix, monitor dialogue intelligibility, and more. As a quick and easy trimming or sweetening tool, or an advanced workflow-saver, Relay is a great choice for any session template.
 
However, we can still make some general observations about tonal balance in a broad sense. First, if we look at the tonal balance for an entire song consisting of a typical mix of drums, bass, voice, and some additional instrumentation, it is not uncommon to have a peak somewhere below 100 Hz with a gentle slope down as we move to higher and higher frequencies. Second, within the context of a given genre, it is not abnormal to have some subtle variation from this typical shape with a reasonably defined maximum deviation above and below the average.
 
And in fact, this type of shape and deviation is exactly what Tonal Balance Control shows us. The target curve selection menu allows us to select from 12 common genres, with each selection being derived from machine learning analysis that used thousands of professional masters from a vast range of commercially released songs in that style. Further, you can create your own custom target curves from either an individual reference track or better yet, an entire folder of reference tracks.
 
Alternatively, turning something up or down can be as useful as EQing. You can do this by adjusting the output gain of the corresponding tool as shown at the top right of the EQ readout in Tonal Balance Control.
 
In the mastering stage of audio production, engineers compare the tonal balance of a reference track with their own work to help guide their EQ decisions. While this is a skill that can take years to hone, Tonal Balance Control can help you here as well. Just add an instance of the Ozone Ozone Advanced Craft the perfect listening experience with Ozone 11, the ultimate collection of mastering tools.

As you can see, the ways in which Neutron, Ozone, Insight, and Tonal Balance Control all integrate together make for a powerful combination that can allow you to speed up your workflow, and provide guidance at the same time. Hopefully this has not only given you some ideas for new ways in which you can use Tonal Balance Control in your projects, but also demonstrated the impact tonal balance adjustments can make.
 
Balance between level and frequency or tonal balance is what gives a mix emotion and power, while a lack of balance can leave mixes sounding like demos. Here are six tips to find that perfect middle ground.
 
In Episode 6, professional mastering engineer and Director of Education Jonathan Wyner demonstrates why we use EQ when mastering, what differentiates EQ in mixing from mastering, and why you should trust your eyes as much as your ears.
 
Tonal Balance Control displays spectrum metering information for the track it is currently inserted on relative to a target curve. This is particularly useful when dealing with tonal balance issues that arise during mixing and mastering. Tonal Balance Control can help provide context and direction toward resolving issues with a mix or master lacking the low-end power or high-end brilliance found in professionally produced, radio-ready material..

- To get the most out of the Tonal Balance Control plug-in, we recommend that it is inserted at the end of the processing chain on your master bus track.
- This ensures that the spectrum curve you are comparing to the currently selected target curve is after all other processing in your session.
- When Tonal Balance Control is last in the processing chain, it ensures that adjustments made to Neutron 2 or Ozone 8 EQ instances will affect the spectrum curve displayed in Tonal Balance Control.

The factory target curves in Tonal Balance Control represent typical spectral shapes found in different styles of music. These target curves were created by analyzing the spectral characteristics of numerous tracks across different genres/styles of music. The target curves display ranges of typical spectral variation across the frequency spectrum for these similar styles of music.
 
**BAND SELECTION & ENABLE/DISABLE CONTROLS:**\* EQ bands can be enabled or disabled by clicking on the power button to the left of the band number.\* Click on the band number directly to view the controls associated with that band.
 
If the Ozone EQ instance selected in Tonal Balance Control is using Mid/Side or Left/Right processing modes, the EQ controls will not appear in the Tonal Balance Control interface. Currently, Tonal Balance Control only supports controlling Ozone EQs that are utilizing Stereo processing mode.
 
Tonal Balance Control can connect to other iZotope plug-ins using Inter Plug-in Communication (IPC)technology. When an IPC source plug-in is selected you can view the selected plug-in output spectrum, adjustoutput gain, and make adjustments to EQ parameters (if the selected plug-in includes EQ controls). This can beuseful for making adjustments to your mix to better match your selected target curve without leaving the TonalBalance Control window. For more information about working with IPC sources, see the IPCSources chapter.

Tonal Balance Control includes a number of factory target curves that represent typical spectral shapes foundin different styles of music. You can also generate and save your own custom targetcurves based on a single track or collection of tracks. You can view and loadavailable target curves using the target curve menu in the plug-in header.
 
Displays your track (in white) against the typical range of spectral variation for the selected target curve(in blue). You can switch between two different Target Meter views: Broad View and FineView. The frequency spectrum is divided into four main frequency ranges:
 
Tonal Balance Control allows you to connect and make adjustments to compatible IPC source plug-ins in yoursession. All compatible IPC source plug-ins allow you to view the output spectrum and adjust output gain.Certain IPC source plug-ins also allow you to adjust EQ parameters. To get started with IPC in Tonal BalanceControl, you need to add a compatible plug-in to a track in your session.
 
The color of the spectrum analyzer and output slider will update to match the main color of the selected IPCsource plug-in. Ozone instances are blue, Nectar instances are gold, Neutron instances are orange, Relayinstances are teal, and Neoverb instances are pink.
 
Clicking on a node will show settings for that band in the EQ controls strip along the bottom of the IPCsource panel. The controls shown in the EQ controls strip depend on the product that is selected.
