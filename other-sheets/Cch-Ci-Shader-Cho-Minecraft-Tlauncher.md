All entities that are sitting inside a boat are invisible, e.g. I cant see my legs, and I can only see a cats head inside the boat. Even without a ressourcepack. How can I fix this? Can I edit this inside the .zip?

download the shader go to minecraft files witch should just be a picture of a file on minecraft Tlauncher or normal minecraft then go to shaders then just past it into the folder it does need to be ziped not unziped then your good
 
one of my fav shaders ever!! one thing i think would make it even more amazing is if the leaves on the tree would move? maybe they are and its a problem that only i have, but if it isnt then that would be a cool thing! :)
 
I was wondering if anyone has run into the following issue of shadows bobbing when bobbing is on and/or jumping?
I am using Windows 11 and the latest forge version for optifine.
If you have a fix please share!

Getting around 70fps with default settings 20 render distance but the second I look at water it drops to 50 and scales down to about 20fps the closer I get to the water is this a problem with the shader pack, optifine, or 1.19? or something else.
 
Most likely, at the very top of the list of shaders in the game, there is a first line that should say something like enable or disable shader support. Just turn it on and the shader list will become active and you will be able to select the shaders supported by the iris.
 
This is an amazing shader other than one problem that kept occurring. This problem is that no matter what skybox settings I enable or disable the very top part of the skybox is always white. This would happen only happen in the overworld oddly. If you have any suggestions on what might be happening or how to fix it, that would be great.
 
I did everything right. But when I join a server it just gives me the dirt loading screen. I do have more than one rescoure pack on. Am I only suppose to click on the complementary Shaders pack in my rescoure pack settings?
 
I open downloads drag it to my home screen go to search bar(not google) and type %appdata% open it go to minecraft resource packs and open minecraft drag the resource pack to the resource pack thing and activate it
 
When I loaded it up it was fine, but after a couple of minutes it just freezes my game. I have noticed the game still works, just all of the visuals are locked in place. I have tried 2 times restarting minecraft and it still wont work. Is there a way to fix this or am I just going to have to not play with the shaders?
 
yea thats what happens to me and it just freezes but theres no sound and so i have to restart mc and its really anooying. but what u can do is go to the launcher and go to installations and click on optifine and press edit. next u press more options and theres the piece of code or something that will probably say 2G. change the 2 to a bigger number like 5 or something and it will give it more ram and ur game might not freeze
 
Many Minecraft users normally will be used to having some graphical enhancements in the form of resource packs and shaders. For copyright reasons code from optifine could not be bundled with RLCraft and information about how to install them on CurseForge and Technic launchers has been limited.
 
Most people playing RLCraft on either CurseForge or Technic launchers might feel installing graphic modifications seem difficult due to lack of instructions or information elsewhere. Possibly experiencing more rage than respawning in a lava pool. Thankfully the reality is that once you know how to do it, installation is actually very simple.
 
Resource packs aka texture packs change the default minecraft graphics into something special, there are many choices and different people are going to find different packs suitable to their own tastes. The RLCraft founder suggests Chromahills, though the cartoon look might not be for everyone. Clarity is a HD pack that looks for though seeking a HD/realism look. Of course, there are a lot more choices just find what you like and download it.
 
Pour installer un shader minecraft il vous faudra tlcharger et installer Optifine, tlcharger un shader, ouvrir le dossier li aux shaders dans les donnes de Minecraft puis faire glisser / dposer le fichier pralablement tlcharger ici. Une fois cela fait, slectionnez le shader dans le menu en jeu.
 
Salut, tu ne pourras pas tlcharger les shaders que nous prsentons sur le site. Toutefois, tu pourras avoir du ray-tracing si tu joues sur W10 et que tu as une carte RTX, voir notre article : BTA DE MINECRAFT AVEC RTX : DES VISUELS POUSTOUFLANTS EN RAY TRACING
