You can see the little usb icon in the systray toggling on/off continuously, and if you look in device manager, the icon is constantly disappearing and reappearing, and you can hear the windows new connection sound effect constantly going off. Intolerable.
 
I should note that when I see intel wireless in my device manager, i can uninstall, but there is no checkbox to delete files as well. This does exist on Intel Bluetooth. When I reboot, the Intel Wireless driver is already reinstalled.

I had recently updated Intel BT drivers and after that no BT device would connect to my desktop PC anymore. The BT on/off toggle had disappeared form that right-side panel accessible from the taskbar. When I opened Device Manager, the entire tree of devices would keep on refreshing every 2 seconds, until I manually disabled the Intel BT adapter (which was being continuously reset or something). I tried all manners of drive removal/upgrade/downgrade to no avail. Of course I tried rebooting the computer and even messed a bit with BIOS configs for nothing.
 
Yep. Like many others, I created an account to say thank you- roughly four years after this thread was created. The solution is still relevant, and it's far and away much easier and less time consuming than any of the other "solutions" I tried.
 
Edit: It might be important to add that different machines might require a longer or shorter interruption in the power supply for this to work. I've seen one person in this thread who unplugged their machine for 15 minutes, but I only unplugged mine for about 30 seconds.

After the last update for Windows 11 insider (Home). The driver for the wireless card stopped working. There is already a guide on the issue on Intel's boards, but it is not working either. So i think the issue is with the Windows.
 
I managed to bring my Killer wireless network adapter back - after wasted a whole morning. Windows updated overnight and I lost the card after that. This was the error I saw in Event Viewer:


 
@OussD After a lot of research, the problem is usually solved by resetting the bios to default, mainly on dell laptops. The problem is caused after doing bios update or installing windows 11.
Also don't forget to install the updated drivers.
 
@ballon999 This is not working on my Surface Pro 7. I've tried uninstalling and removing the driver completely several times and each time on the restart it automatically comes back (even when I'm not connected to the internet). I had Windows 11 and reverted back to Windows 10 and still not right.
 
I had a similar issue when I got my first wifi 6 networking card. My solution was to turn off automatic band selection in the wifi router settings. Apparently the network card couldn't handle when the band changed (something that the router did seemingly randomly), and so the network card errored out and stopped working until it was reset. However, after I turned off automatic band selection there hasn't been another issue, with that machine.
 
Everyone, try removing the driver then shutting down the OS, not reset/reboot. I've been fighting this for 2 days straight and even after a complete OS reinstall/downgrade from 11 to 10 the problem is still there. Immediately after the reinstall the wifi adapter worked, but after a few reboots it went back to the same issues/events in the system log. Then I tried removing the driver and shutting down completely before powering back on and the wifi is now working. For how long who knows, but give this a shot if you are struggling.
 
I am stunned that you can install Windows 10 without some sort of wireless driver. My mac mini is not near ethernet. When can I find the right driver? I just finished a boot camp setup. Everything works fine, except no wireless
 
Would like to know if any one got successfully installed Windows server 2012 R2 drivers. I am trying to install wireless drivers for couple of days now and couldn't get them working. Any help would be really appreciated.
 
If you want any chance of the BT to work, you need to reinstall W7, install the connection manager, turn on the HP integrated BT module with the connection Manager, uninstall the connection manager, restart the PC. Verify the BT is still present in the device manager and then reinstall windows server 2012.
 
If you see the Intel 6205 under the network adapters device category, and it shows working normally but it isn't, then I would say that there is no solution to get that card to work on Windows Server 2012.
 
Broadcom driver is working fine when ubuntu 14.10 is not yet installed on my system. But when I installed it alongside with Windows 7(Dual Boot) it says that "This device is not working"(Broadcom). I cant connect WIFI in ubuntu but it does in Windows 7. I search solutions in windows 7, i boot ubuntu, and it doesn't work. I boot windows again, boot ubuntu again. Thats what im doing every-time but i can't fixed it. Help me lease. Thanks :)
 
If you have no internet capability, then do the purge step and then download this on some other computer: =0 Transfer it on a USB or similar to your Ubuntu computer and drop it on your desktop. Right-click it and select 'Extract Here.' Now, in the terminal:
 
I have an issue where my bootcamp install of Windows 10 has nonworking audio drivers and wireless networking drivers after installing the default selection of cross platform mobile development pieces.
 
On my system this is 100% replicable. All i have to do is create a bootcamp install of windows 10 64 bit. Install visual studio keep defaults. download and install the Xamarin for Visual Studio keep defaults.
 
After rebooting the sound driver has a red circle white x. Wireless networking has a red circle white x. Both drivers report all is well but neither work. I have tried reinstalling the drivers from the apple drivers... I don't recall the name of the drivers installer.
 
This led Dell to believe that there is something wrong with the Windows installation and asked me to reformat my computer. I would rather not reformat at this point, so I am looking for anything at all at this point. The only similar situation I found online was on an Intel support board and it appears the issue was never resolved. I appreciate any help you might be able to provide. Thanks!
 
Have you by any chance uninstalled the driver. When I have had similar issues with other Dell laptopsa I have resolved it by going to device manager and right clicking the wireless adapter and choosing uninstall. When it compltes the uninstall right click on any node and choose scan for new hardware, it should re-install the driver. Hopefully it will display all the wireless networks available.
 
I gotta agree with Matthew. If the OS sees it, installs it, and shows up in device manager with no errors, you should be good to go. The antenna seems the most likely culprit. Either that, or any type of manual switches that shut it off or on. You said you checked that already, so back to the antenna.
 
If you encounter a lack of wireless network connectivity during the initial setup (Out of Box Experience, OOBE) after installing the operating system using Windows 11 installation media (as shown in the image below), you can attempt to load the appropriate drivers during the installation process.
