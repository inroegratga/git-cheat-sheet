The serifs help guide the eye along the letters and create a sense of flow. They are commonly used for body text in printed materials like books, newspapers, and magazines, as they aid in readability.

Decorative fonts, also known as display or novelty fonts, are characterized by their unique and distinctive designs. These fonts often deviate from traditional letterforms and can be highly stylized, ornamental, or thematic.
 
Why is it important that you learn the anatomy of typography? The answer is just as simple as the question. Typography anatomy is crucial because it provides a framework for understanding the visual structure and characteristics of typefaces and implementing font psychology.
 
By studying and recognizing the various components that make up letterforms, such as the spine, stem, and stroke, designers gain a deeper understanding of how each element contributes to the overall appearance and legibility of a typeface.
 
Ultimately, typography anatomy serves as a shared language that enhances the precision and clarity of typographic design, enabling designers to create visually appealing and well-structured typography.

A serif is a short line at the beginning and the end of strokes. Serifs are what make a typeface a serif or a sans serif. Serifs can have different shapes: hairline, square/slab, wedge. They can all be bracketed or unbracketed, meaning that their connection to the stroke is rounded or perpendicular.
 
A swash is a fancy or decorative replacement to a terminal or serif in any capital letter used at the beginning of a sentence. Swashes are also used at the end of letters to decorate the composition. Calligraphy is full of swashes of all kinds; at the beginning, at the end and even in the middle, extending from ascenders.

There are ways to style typography to more effectively get your message across. The most common typography styles are italic and **bold**. Regular typefaces can be turned into bold or italic in any graphic design editor. Bold styles are great for headlines and highlighting important parts of text. Using bold styles for links makes them more prominent and easy to see. Italics are used mainly for words in a different language or reference links.
 
Some typefaces have more options. A typeface family can have as many as 20 styles or more. Futura, a very versatile typeface family, has 22 styles. Some of the most memorable Futura styles are light, condensed, semi-bold, extra bold, bold condensed and book italic.
 
Apart from the styles covered above that work for all sorts of text and designs, there are also hundreds of other styles! Novelty fonts have all sorts of different styles, from whimsical and hand drawn, to culturally inspired. These novelty fonts cannot be turned into bold or italics because they only exist in the style they were designed in.
 
Earlier, we highlighted some best practices, techniques and rules that will give you a better understanding of how to implement typography, so to help solidify these rules here are some basic rules of typography you should also keep in mind as you apply them to your designs.
 
Contrast plays a vital role in the world of typography. It involves purposefully incorporating variations in size, weight, color, or style to bring visual intrigue and differentiate between different elements.
 
By dividing your layout into a grid system, you establish a sense of structure and orderliness, facilitating the harmonious arrangement of various typographic elements such as headings, paragraphs, and images.
 
Distorting fonts by stretching, squeezing, or skewing them can have a detrimental impact on their legibility and aesthetic appeal. It disrupts the proportions and compromises the intended design integrity of the typeface.

Sometimes letters need to be adjusted to fit in a certain space. There are three different ways in which type can be moved around in a space so that it looks better. These three measurements are called kerning, tracking and leading.
 
Tracking is the proportional space between all the letters in a body of text. Being able to change the tracking helps fit more letters in a small space or spread out letters if they are too tight. Script fonts cannot undergo too much tracking due to how the ligatures separate and create unbalanced spaces.
 
Designers manipulate the tracking when they want to accomplish a look that has even edges for all the words. By spreading out the tracking or making it tighter, they can make all the text look unified and justified.
 
Leading and x-height have a direct effect on how text will look in a paragraph. There is another measurement we should mention called **the baseline***,* which is the line on which letters sit horizontally. The bottom of the x-height of each letter sits on a baseline.
 
The lower the x-height compared to the cap height, the more white space there will be between lines. When letters have a higher x-height in comparison to the cap height, the leading looks more balanced and ordered.

When typesetting, designers measure the height of x-height, ascenders, and descenders from the baseline to create balanced and harmonious **typography**. Watch this video for a simple example of Gestalt Principles in typography.
 
Old-style numerals come in different heights. Some go above the x-height, others drop below the baseline, like uppercase and lowercase letters. In typography, numerals have special terms like ascender, descender, and x-height. These terms define their shape and readability in a typeface and correspond to similar features in letters.
 
The thickness of a letter's stroke determines its **weight**. Letters may appear in capital letters known as **uppercase**, in smaller forms known as **lowercase**, or in short capital letters designed to blend with lowercase text known as **small capitals**.
 
A **stroke** is a straight or curved line that creates the principal part of a letter. A curved stroke originating from a stem is a **shoulder**. A stroke that is more or less straight is a **stem**. A curved stroke is a **spine**. The horizontal stroke in letters is known as a **cross bar**.
 
A stroke added to the beginning or end of a letter is a **serif**. Similarly, a tapered or curved end on a letterform is a **finial** and a circular form at the end of the arm, leg or brow in letters is known as a **terminal**.

Cover letters; they are designed to accompany to every application you submit, and each one you write could mean the difference between being chosen for an interview or passed over. Many clients I work with find cover letters confusing, and are not sure how to write one without sounding redundant to their resume.
 
A cover letter is different from a resume in that it takes on a narrative format, and goes into specifics, while a resume uses bullet points, and communicates generic accomplishments and quantifiable impact. It is essentially a short essay that you write as a way to demonstrate to the employer that you are the best candidate for the position, both in your professional and personal identity.
 
Today, most job seekers are applying to hundreds of openings a week. The idea of crafting a unique page-long narrative on your skills and experiences as well as specifics to the position and the company itself seems daunting to say the least. Is it a good use of your time to make unique cover letters for every position? The answer is both a yes and a no.
 
1. **Contact information:** Put the employers contact information at the top, and put your contact information in the header of your cover letter (name, email and phone number and address). This will save space on the page for you to write more
