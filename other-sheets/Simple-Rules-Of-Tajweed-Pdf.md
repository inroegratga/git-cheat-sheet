The document provides a summary of simple rules of tajweed (proper recitation) of the Quran. It covers the correct pronunciation of letters, full mouth letters, open and closed letters, rules for letters with nasal sounds (ghunnah, idghaam, ikhfa, izhaar) and other letters like meem and ra. It also discusses symbols of stopping, rules for stopping, changing letters at the end of words when stopping, and the mudd technique of lengthening sounds.

Tajweed is the science that teaches how to read the Quran beautifully and without mistakes by observing the Makhraj and characteristics of the Quranic letters and following the rules of tajweed. The purpose of Tajweed is to protect the language from mistakes while reciting the Quran. Among the main topics covered in this science are:

Another factor that makes Tajweed rules necessary is that the language of the Quran is Arabic. Therefore, it should be read in accordance with the characteristics of this language. Since the Quran must be read according to certain rules, Tajweed, which is a kind of sum of these rules, is an integral part of the Quran recitation.
 
It is a fact that human nature always tends to do it in the most beautiful way, it tends to read in a way that touches the heart and heals the soul. It makes people feel awe, and this makes the worship beautiful.
 
In the time of the Prophet, there was no reason for people to learn the Quran with Tajweed. Because then, Tajweed rules that wanted to be learned now were part of their language. With the spread of Islam, those whose mother tongue is not Arabic began to learn the science of Tajweed with some rules in order to pronounce the Quran in the most correct way and not to disturb the meaning pattern. Today, Muslims from all over the world strive to learn this science, both in Quran courses and online Quran lessons.
 
Since the Quran was sent down with its wording and meaning, it is Fard Kifayah to learn Tajweed in order to preserve its wording in its original form. Accordingly, it is sufficient for some Muslims to know the rules of tajweed. Those who know receive their reward, but those who do not know do not become sinners.
 
However, it has been deemed Wajib to follow the rules of tajweed while reciting the Quran in a way that avoids the clear mistakes, which occur when the letters in the verses we recite in prayer, especially in prayer, are corrupted.
 
As for Noon Sakeen: It is called Noon with Jazm without movement (Harakah). Tanween and Noon Sakeen are read in one of the forms Ikhfaa, Izhaar, Idgham, and Iqlaab according to the letters that follow them.

It means joining a non-vowel with a vowel so that the two letters become one letter of the second type. As for the meaning of Ghunnah, it is the sound coming from the mouth and nasal cavities for 2 beats.
 
Another basic tajweed rule that should definitely be known is the Madd. The letters of Madd are letters without movement (Harakah) ى و ا. Madd letters allow the letters in front of them to be read by being stretched for a duration of different amounts such as two, four, or six beats.
 
Two-beat Madd is also called natural Madd. In other words, the Madd (elongation) feature is due to the letter itself. It is not based on any subsequent reason such as hamza or Sukoon and its duration is two beats.
 
Qalqalah in tajweed means echoing the Makhraj so that a strong sound is heard. If one of the Qalqalah letters is found without Harakah in the middle of the word, a quick echo should be given. Also, when the Qalqalah letter is at the end of the word, Qalqalah should be pronounced a bit stronger.
 
If one of the letters noon or meem has a Shaddah sign, two-beat Ghunnah is applied during the recitation. One point should be noted that even if a pause is made on that letter, two-beat Ghunnah is still pronounced. Example:
 
The more Tajweed rules you hear, the more you hear the sounds of the correct application of the rules, and the more you will remember the application of the rules. The Quran with the QR codes is very beneficial in this context today.
 
Circle the Tajweed rule you have learned in the Quran with a pencil and write down what it is. Repeat this tactic for the first few days. After a certain time, you will automatically recognize the rules InshaAllah.
 
When explaining it to someone else, you make an effort not to get things wrong, and this actually teaches you in the best way. You can also record yourself explaining the rules you learn and how to apply them.
 
This process, which varies according to the learning speed of the person, can take between 2 months and 6 months on average and it may be shortened or prolonged depending on the person. Taking regular weekly lessons and allocating specific time for learning will increase productivity.
 
And again, one of the most influential factors in this process is a good guide. Getting support from someone who is experienced in teaching Tajweed is very important in terms of being able to apply what you have learned and being permanent. Remember, it is not about how quickly you learn, but how permanently you learn.
 
Is Tajweed Easy to Learn? Well, learning to read the Quran in the most beautiful way with Tajweed is a process that requires effort, as every beautiful thing requires effort and patience. But in this process, your teacher choice is of great importance. For example, if you learn Tajweed from an Arab Quran Tutor simultaneously with Quran lessons, your ear will become more familiar with the native Arabic accent and Tajweed rules, making the process easier.

Theoretical *Tajweed* learning involves discussing each Tajweed rule theoretically without implementing or performing *Tajweed* recitation of the Quran. While practical *Tajweed* learning focuses on the phonetic laws of *Tajweed* and how to correctly read and recite the Quran in Arabic.
 
There are many detailed laws of tajweed which take a long time to study. However this booklet contains the most basic laws which, if learnt, thoroughly , will enable a learner on the Maktab level to recite the Quraan Shareef correctly.
 
Tajweed literally means to adorn and beautify. In the contaxt of the recitation of the Quraan Shareef, tajweed refers to the correct pronunciation of the letters and applying the various rules of recitation.
 
**Al-Madd Al-Laazim Al-Harfee:** letter based necessary prolongation is the second branch of al-madd al-laazim. This posts discusses the difference between al-madd al-laazim harfee mukhfaffaf and harfee muthaqal as outlined in the diagram.
 
Both types of madd laazim harfee only apply to those chapters in the Quran that start with letters. Some of these surahs include Surat Al-Baqarah, Surat Maryam, and Surat Qaaf. Each surah begins with letters that have a special case, all of which the al-madd al-laazim tajweed rule covers.
 
Al-madd al-laazim hafree muthaqal (heavy letter based necessary prolongation) only occurs in one form (in the Quran). It is where one of the letters (at the opening of a surah) is pronounced using three sounds, where the middle sound is a harf madd and the last sound is merged with the beginning sound of the next letter.
 
Al-madd al-laazim hafree mukhaffaf (light letter based necessary prolongation) applies to those letters which do not merge. Each letter is prolonged for 6 counts, except where the above exceptions occur. The letters for this type of madd have 3 sounds. The middle is a harf madd, and the end is a saakin (hence why no merging occurs). An example is the letter qaaf.
 
Have you ever been in those situations where an awkward silence is bound to happen? And when it does, it feels as though time stretches tenfold? Check out what happens to this stretchy prolongation when it hits a short silence (sukoon)!
 
Here you can see how the madd becomes void when you are continuing onto the next word, and how it is sounded when you are stopping. Of course, what ever you do, keep in mind that this madd is only for tanween fat-**h**. You definitely do not say a madd when it is tanween **d**amm or kasr.
 
**Al-Madd Al-Waajib Al-Mutasil**: is the obligatory prolongation. It is prolonged for either four or five counts (your choice of either). If you choose to prolong for four counts, then this must remain consistent throughout your recitation. Likewise is if you chose to prolong for five counts.
