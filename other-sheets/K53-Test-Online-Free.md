**Effective February 7, 2022:** If you are applying for a CDL for the first time or adding a Hazmat, Passenger, or School Bus endorsement for the first time, you must complete entry-level driver training (ELDT) before taking a CDL road test. Hazmat ELDT is required before taking the Hazardous Materials knowledge test. The training provider must be registered on the FMCSA Training Provider Registry. Go to the Entry Level Driver Training (ELDT) FAQ for more information about the ELDT requirement.

The road test scheduling system offers the earliest available dates and times at sites near the ZIP code you provide. Usually, the earliest date is within 3 to 5 weeks, but at peak testing periods during summer and school breaks it may be up to 10 weeks away. There are no waiting lists. Tests are almost always on weekdays (only rarely do we offer them on a Saturday).
 
Tests can be canceled/rescheduled or relocated due to bad weather or road construction. Before you leave for your test, check the DMV cancellations, closings, and delays webpage or call 1-518-402-2100.
 
After the road test, the examiner will give you instructions on how to receive your test results by visiting roadtestresults.nyrtsscheduler.com. Your results will be posted to the website after 6 p.m. on the day of your test.

You may not receive scores from more than one test date during a scheduled national (Saturday, non-Saturday, or rescheduled test date arranged by ACT). If you are admitted and allowed to test a second time, we will report only the scores from the first test. The second or third set of scores will be cancelled without refund.
 
You may not receive scores from more than one test date per state administration (initial or makeup) if your school participates in ACT State and District Testing. If you are allowed to test more than once, we will report only the scores from the first test. The second set of scores will be cancelled.
 
**Test Center Change for the same test date** - If a seat and materials are available for your test option at your new preferred test center on your preferred test date, you will be able to make a test center change. You cannot request a test center change after the late registration deadline. Instead, find out about requesting standby testing.
 
**Test Date Change** - A test date change can be used to sign up for a different test date if you are absent or unable to test on the original test date or if your registration is cancelled for failure to meet ACT's test security requirements.
 
IMPORTANT: Once you break the seal on your test booklet, you cannot later request a test date change, even if you do not complete all your tests. You must register again and pay the full fee for your test option if you want to retest.
 
Log in to your MyACT account and select "Make Changes to Your Registration" or call ACT Registration at 319.337.1270 by the regular deadline for the new test date. You will be charged the full fee for the new test date in addition to the test date change fee.
 
If you call during the late registration period, you will also be charged a late fee. In either case, your basic fee for the original test date will be refunded. (If you register for a new test date instead of making a test date change, your basic fee for the original test date will not be refunded.)
 
If you decide you do not want to test on another test date, your registration fee and any additional fees (such as late fee or test center change fee) are nonrefundable. If you do not test, no score reports will be sent.
 
If you miss the late deadline to register for a test date, or to request a test date or test center change, you may choose to sign in to your ACT account to request and pay for standby testing. Accommodations may be available for standby testing, but seats are not guaranteed. You may contact ACT to see if there is an available seat, test materials, and staff to administer the test.
