The SSETPRODEFVIEWER is the command to set as the default viewer for PDF files. Other than that it should work. I've noticed this posting back in 2014 -communications-inc/nuance-power-pdf-advanced/1-14104

If you find that a dialog is taking too much time because the endpointer is taking too long to declare the end of speech, you can speed up the dialog by shortening the timeouts. This is especially effective if you deal with many experienced or advanced users who already know what they need to say.
 
However, when the timeouts are too short the interpreter is more likely cut off users during a pause and generate a nomatch or noinput event that will take time to recover from, making the dialog longer rather than shorter.
 
The timeout sets the maximum period of time that Voice Platform waits for a reply after playing a prompt. If the caller has not replied by the end of this period, Voice Platform throws a noinput event and either reprompts or proceeds to the next instruction in the VoiceXML file.

A default value can be set in the application root document, and different values can be set for each dialog state, depending on the active grammars. For optimal performance, we recommend that you use the following guidelines:
 
The completetimeout property is best used with simple, closed grammars such as a list of names. Use it to reduce the wait for end-of-speech once a valid recognition has occurred. Shorter settings result in faster response times, but risk interrupting callers before they are done speaking.
 
Note that the maxspeechtimeout value is measured from the beginning of speech, rather than the end of the prompt. This means that the full period is available even if the caller pauses before beginning to speak.
 
Neural TTS requires far less training and tuning than traditional TTS systems, and it can be trained in English and then learn to respond in other languages. That further reduces the time, cost, and effort of creating advanced conversational AI applications, and it enables our customers to have a single voice represent their brand globally.
 
By accessing these services as APIs, our customers can also move existing applications to the cloud and take advantage of high levels of availability, scalability, and security. And because our Conversational AI Services integrate with leading IVR and Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) platforms, organizations that have invested in building, tuning, and optimizing applications can move to the cloud knowing their existing solutions will continue to generate ROI.
 
Nuance continues to invest in evolving the Conversational AI Services portfolio by adding new services and optimizing the underlying algorithms based on our latest research. So, keep an eye out for more exciting announcements in the future as we discover new ways to power intelligent omnichannel customer engagement.
