One workaround I found is to install Oracle Virtualbox and create a virtual PC. You then need a windows licences to install xindows and boot on it. Then you attach the HD camera to your virtual PC under windows , and run Cisco webex in the windows environment.
 
I spoke with a couple of Cisco reps in the past couple weeks and they indicated it might be fixed in Meeting Center v29. I'm waiting for official confirmation and if there will be any backwards compatibility.

I am leaning towards it being the ultrabook that is attached to the camera and running webex but again am new and may be way off base. It is a Dell 7370 Ultrabook that is being used. I do not see it having much for a processor or any video card at all for capturing the webex meeting in high def. Could this be the issue? And do you have any recommendations for hardware specs to solve the recording and video quality issues. We do not have network issues and are hard wired at all times.
 
Now I have an external monitor attached and a camera on top of it. This camera (brand: aukey) is much further away and now shows almost the complete room, and my face is only a small spot in the camera image.
 
Whether you are working from home or you are in the office, the Cisco Desk Camera is your perfect solution for high quality meetings from anywhere. Enable up to 4K ultra-HD video for everyone with a versatile USB webcam and experience the professional hybrid work space of tomorrow.

Modern and state of the art centralization management. You can manage your webcam and its setting from Control Hub. No more wasting time for device set up. Start your next video call in just a few minutes!
 
@route\_map you certainly can and I have this working in my home lab just fine, the MV detects human motion, triggers an alert and sends a snapshot from the camera via a Webex Teams chatbot. Here's a self-paced guided lab to get it going! cs.co/adventure
 
The Cisco Room cameras bring your small or large meeting rooms to life. When mounted on a mobile stand, the collaboration system brings the flexibility to adjust the environment to fit the needs of the team meeting. For small huddle spaces, a mobile solution allows the camera to be moved to fit the size and location of the audience. You are no longer dependent on a wall-mounted solution.
 
Step 3: If you have already installed the desktop application, click **Open Webex** to do so. If you do not have the application installed, click **Join from your browser** to join directly from your web browser.
 
Sometimes, you might need to test your Webex camera while you are already in a live meeting. For example, you might want to check if your camera is working properly, adjust your video settings, or switch to a different camera device. Fortunately, Webex has a built-in feature that allows you to do that easily and quickly.
 
FineCam is an AI virtual camera software that allows you to use your smartphone as a webcam for your computer. It works with Webex and other video conferencing platforms, and it offers some advantages over a regular webcam, such as:
 
You can share your iPhone screen, app windows, YouTube videos, web pages, presentations, videos, and photos during the meeting. This can help you communicate your ideas more effectively and creatively.
 
You can choose various filters and effects for your videos, such as Instagram-like filters, old film effects, glitch effects, and more. You can also change your camera shapes to overlay yourself on any content.
 
With FineCam, you can record a Webex Meeting in high quality and save it as MP4 files. Additionally, you can record many videos at once using the segment recording feature, which enables you to continue recording at any time.
 
Testing your Webex camera before and during a meeting is a simple and effective way to ensure high-quality video communication. By using the methods described in this article, you can avoid any technical issues or glitches that might affect your video quality or appearance.
 
With the Webex JavaScript SDK, we have access to our local media stream. This means that we can build an app to receive our local camera feed, take some action on it, and apply it as our outbound stream to a Webex meeting. That way, if we wanted to apply a filter to ourselves, the other users in the Webex meeting would see the filtered version of our feed.
 
The demo application we're writing about here leverages handtrack.js to detect faces and hands. Handtrack.js is built using tensorflow, which is a popular open-source machine learning library for JavaScript. In short, our demo app uses the Webex JS SDK to join a meeting, and uses the handtrack.js library to "edit" our camera stream, which is then applied to our Webex meeting.
 
If you're new to Webex programmability, you can learn more about the Webex Browser SDK, as well as the other available SDKs from However, this application should provide everything you need to get started, and we'll cover some of the basics here as well.
 
You can read more about this process from this blog. The one thing our app does in addition, is it allows us to update our video stream for the Webex meeting, using the updateVideo() function. Once an outbound media stream exists for the meeting, you can use the updateVideo() function to apply a different MediaStream object as your video source. So we know how to update the video stream for a Webex meeting, but how do we manipulate our local stream in the first place?
 
Referencing the above code snippet, toggleVideo() is how we start tracking faces and hands. Our app starts this as soon as we know we have a local stream available. toggleVideo() calls the function runDetection(), and our runDetection() function looks like this:
 
This is where things can start to look a little funky. If you've looked through the code, you might have noticed that canvas and context variables are initialized. This is because the handtrack.js library we're using writes the altered stream to an html canvas element (when we renderPredictions()). This means we have to read the canvas stream back in, then apply it as our outbound stream. Ideally, we would apply the face and hand bounding boxes directly to the outbound stream, rather than write it to a canvas element just to read it back in. This is merely a limitation of the library we're using here. The only requirement for our outbound stream is that it be a WebRTC MediaStream with a video track. Conveniently, the captureStream() function of the canvas element returns this MediaStream object to us. So, even though we had to apply the altered video to a canvas element first, we can easily grab the result with the captureStream() function.
 
We can open our index.html file in a browser to see this demo in action! You'll need to copy a Webex token into the authorize field, and click the authorize button. Assuming you have a Webex account, you can grab a 12 hour test token by signing into this page and clicking the copy icon. After you authorize, you can enter a Webex meeting link, Webex person email, or API roomId and click join. Once you have joined a meeting, you can click the startTracking button to see the face and hand bounding boxes - and the other meeting participants will see them too!
 
Webex Room Kit Plus P60 is a powerful collaboration solution that integrates with flat panel displays to bring more intelligence and versatility to your collaboration spaces. This package combines the performance of Codec Plus and the flexibility of the Cisco Precision 60 Camera to offer maximum flexibility in scenarios where you need special camera placement, objects close up, or wide pan-tilt-zoom capability.
 
Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, is the software of choice for many, if not most, of today's online streamers. This open source software lets users create "scenes" using their webcam feed, along with any videos or images they want to use. The scenes are then pushed live to their streaming platform of choice, such as YouTube or Twitch, or to a recording. The original use case for OBS was simple and enabled video gamers to overlay their webcam image over a corner of their video game for their online streams. Viewers could see the game at full-screen, as well as the real-time reactions of the gamer in the corner.
 
Over time, OBS has added numerous features and capabilities as streamers sought to enhance their videos and stand out. The software is now practically a full-featured live video editor. Just about anything a user can do in post-production with traditional video editors, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, they can now do live in OBS. Premiere Pro can turn video into a professional production, but it requires a recorded video file and is expensive software. OBS is free and can edit and produce a live feed in real time.
