You are going to love having all the professional DJ features that come with Party Mix Pro. In addition to the speaker, you have full control of the music with two decks and a crossfader to blend/ scratch your music. Four cue points to mark your tracks at different positons. You can toggle through the Pad Mode to access auto loop function, sound effects, and sound sampler.
 
The built-in lights sync to your music, flashing from the grille of the Party Mix Pro, illuminating your environment. They add ambiance to any space, pulsating to the beat, setting the perfect party mood. You can also turn them off and go for a completely different feel.
 
The original Party Mix quickly became one of the best-selling DJ controllers of all time. The Party Mix II takes the legacy to the next level with even more pro-level features added to the mix! The Party Mix II is always ready for a good time. Simply plug in your laptop or mobile device and start mixing your ultimate party playlist. With the flick of a switch, the built-in light show takes things to the next level with a colorful light show that dances to the beat.
 
You no longer need a huge music library to start DJing. The Party Mix II DJ controller works with Serato Lite DJ software, giving you access to streaming services like TIDAL, Beatport LINK, Beatsource LINK, and SoundCloud GO. A streaming DJ controller means that the hottest tracks are available at your fingertips for you to create your custom party playlist.
 
If you'd rather bring a phone or tablet to the party, the Party Mix II is also compatible with popular DJ mobile apps like djay PRO AI by Algorriddim. Just connect your mobile device to the Party Mix II by using a USB camera connection kit (sold separately) to get the party started.
 
Set the party atmosphere with a DJ controller with lights! The Party Mix II features three multi-colored LEDs with special wide-coverage lenses for a room-filling, beat-synchronized light show. The switch on the side of the controller allows you to turn the light show on and off whenever you like.

The Party Mix II has enough pro-grade features to handle virtually any party. The 1/8-inch main audio output allows you to hook up external speakers to bring your music to life while still monitoring the mix with the 1/8-inch headphone output connection.
 
Four performance pads on each deck allow quick access to cue points, loops, effects or samples. In addition to Play and Cue buttons on each deck, Sync buttons allow for the automatic tempo matching of two tracks for perfectly aligned mixes. Dedicated Filter knobs on each deck help add a pro-grade sound to your mixes, and the software-adjustable crossfader allows for sharp cuts for scratches or long, smooth fades for mixes.
 
The Party Mix II also features two large, high-quality jog wheels that respond to your touch and allow you to manipulate your music with style. Backspin, pause, and even scratch your tracks as you work your way through your party playlist. The outer rings of the wheels function as a pitch-bend so that you can nudge tracks into alignment for the perfect mix.
 
There have been in the last few years several treads regarding virtual audio routing and I would like to have a bit of a summary and to see whether there is some consensus. I am using Djay AI on Ios (iPad).
 
My current setup has an old, crappy Bluetooth transmitter/receiver pair delivering 320 kbps at 16 bit (?) and around 30 ms latency (little noticeable), i.e. Spotify quality - although I am not able to quantify the audio quality loss is in the DADA conversions to connect soundcard, Bluetooth pair, and speaker.
Depending on the intended use, this setup can be cost-effective (read cheap) and workable. One can also add a stand-alone Bluetooth pair for the headphones.
 
A modern Bluetooth transmitter/receiver pair can give almost CD quality, no latency, and a stable connection for under 200$. Definitely a reliable technology and stand-alone in the setup. I will try to develop a system that allows me to stay digital until the speaker side Bluetooth receiver.
 
Of course, I would still like to DJ using the full definition and quality potential of my audio system using wifi streaming, and I reckon this is still not achievable and not in sight, especially in regards to audio quality.
 
Hello everyone and thanks for reading this! I recently received a Numark Virtual DJ Partymix box as a gift, which is cool, but neither myself nor the tech advisor from Numark knows how to hook this device up to Sonar Professional or Reason. The advisor says he knows it can be done but doesn't know how to actually pull this off as of yet. I can return this to GC for a refund but I only have 9 days left before I am stuck with this thing.
 
So, I am terribly afraid of jacking around with my settings in Sonar and don't want to blindly mess with everything just to try to make this box work with my set up. BUT, maybe, just maybe, someone here knows how to alter settings in Sonar to allow this thing to be used as an instrument within the software...I hope.
 
Also, I received this message in my interface while trying to get this to work: Not enough memory. I don't get this because I have 16 GB, more or less and this Serrato lite software that comes with this can't possibly be that big.
 
As for the "Not enough memory" message, I have gotten that many times when SONAR/Cakewalk cannot access a midi device because another program is using it. In my case, it almost always happens when I an testing a midi device with midi-ox, forget that I didn't close that down, and then boot Sonar/Cakewalk.
 
Are you trying to use the DJ hardware as a midi device in SONAR/Cakewalk while other midi software has control of it? If so, does Cakewalk have the memory issue if you don't have the other software running first?
 
Thanks so much, user905133, I really appreciate your effort! Your second message is almost exactly what I got, minus the the device. How much memory does this thing require! No matter what I have tried thus far, which is everything that you mentioned, I still get the "not enough memory" message.
 
Yes, I am trying to see if either Reason or Sonar can run this as an instrument, I guess you would say. I don't have a great deal of experience or knowledge pertaining to the inner workings of sound cards or Sonar. I guess I am trying to do something which can't be done maybe but it sure seems to me like it ought to be workable.
 
Another odd thing is that when I plugged this in today, I was surprised when I heard audio for the first time. However, it is playing independently of Sonar and Reason--just in it's own display. So, the problem is still the same for me. I can't figure out how to get Sonar and Reason to actually "pick up" the Numark device although it did play at first, it now does not (after me messing around with it and trying to get it to run through Sonar and Reason).
 
I know someone who has a larger model and if I weren't hunkered down I'd ask if I can bring my laptop over to see if I can connect it to Cakewalk and try to figure it out. (I wondered about the possibility after I saw the controller in action like 6 or 8 months ago, but they are out of my budget.)
 
I don't think the issue is lack of memory in your system. I don't know how that works, but I always assumed the issue was due to some sort of midi device conflict, as id the OS/Software is saying--"Some other software [possibly a device driver] has control of this device, I cannot access it."
 
BTW, yesterday I tried the Virtual DJ software a second time, shut it down, and then had the same issue with Cakewalk and my usb keyboard. I did not see the Virtual DJ software in Windows' task manager, so I couldn't kill it to that solved the midi device lock up. I ended up rebooting my PC.
 
Hmmmm. As a followup test, I just booted the Virtual DJ 2020 software. I did not "Connect" online when it asked, but with the limited feature set, the free software works to play tunes. I then booted Cakewalk and got this:
 
This tells me that the VirtualDJ 2020 software has control of those devices, just like MIDI-OX would--but only for those devices I have selected in MIDI-OX. I think its a Windows/MIDI device thing. Again, maybe someone with more expertise can explain why and make suggestions.
 
The only thing I can suggest being totally unfamiliar with DJ devices as controllers (except for Midiman Dm2--something that last worked under Win98SE), is to try using the Numark unit from a PC reboot without running any other music software other than Cakewalk.
 
ADDENDUM: With the free VirtualDJ 2020 software playing two tunes, I booted Cakewalk and had the three MIDI devices locked out. Using Windows' Device Manager, I killed VirtualDJ 2020 [End Task], went to Cakewalk Preferences and had the usb keyboard locked up, not nanoKontrol.
 
Again, I defer to others to explain this and to offer possible suggestions. Maybe my
