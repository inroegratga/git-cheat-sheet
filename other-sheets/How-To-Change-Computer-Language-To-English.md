When that application regains input focus, Windows tries to switch back to the input language it previously stored for that application. I am not sure about middle click, but the Windows key and Alt-Tab definitely induce the input focus to be switched to a different application, and thus potentially switch the input language.

If you use only two layouts and one of them includes a key for switching to/from QWERTY (like Korean and Hebrew), uninstall all other layouts. Just use the single layout's ability to switch to/from QWERTY. Note the layout's QWERTY input state is still stored and automatically switched between different applications. I've used this method to switch between QWERTY and Korean input in a sane, predictable way.
 
Portable Keyboard Layout (PKL) is used for supporting alternate input languages on (other) computers without admin access. It maintains the same input language state across all applications. A keyboard shortcut for switching between layouts can be configured. Works from a USB drive. Free and open-source.

The above settings add the Hebrew layout and the Alt + Left Shift keyboard short-cut you are used to (I would uninstall all other layouts and keyboard shortcuts on Windows so they don't interfere, or use different keyboard shortcuts)
 
As a side note, I modified the PKL script to support the odd combination of Korean Hangul input and Colemak layout. With the default PKL install, Korean input is horribly broken because it expects a QWERTY layout...
 
Alt + Left arrow = Back in browsing, if you have a 4/5 button mouse or if you have a multimedia keyboard with a back button on it, it's possible your accidentally contact the back button which send the same key code through as pressing Alt & Left Arrow.

Did you know that you can change the primary language of your computer? This is a fantastic feature that you might use in many ways, like if you're trying to learn a different language. However, changing your computer's default language will not change your internet browser's language or other programs. This wikiHow article teaches you how to change your computer's language on a Windows PC or Mac.
 
Although your Mac is set to display the language of the country or region in which it was purchased, you can choose a different language to use. You can also choose different languages for individual apps.
 
Springer Industrial started building finishing production lines more than thirty years ago, and while the technology included in those lines has changed significantly since then, the ways that we judge a successful installation have not.
 
Is there any way to detect a client's computer language?I have developed my website in 2 languages: English and German. If people in Germany open my web site it should open the German version, otherwise it will open the English version for any other country of origin.
 
Use the Accept-Language header. This is the language that the user has explicitly requested by setting it up in the browser options (defaulting to the browser's installation language otherwise). The header can contain multiple languages with ratings eg:
 
In other browsers, it gives you the browser install language, which is a reasonable guess but not as good as the language the user has actually asked for. On IE browserLanguage is the same thing, and there's also userLanguage and systemLanguage which relate to the Windows locale, which is usually a much worse guess.
 
I live in Finland so my Mac's regional settings are set to be Finnish. However, everything else in my computer (including excel) are in English language. The computer, the Excel view and the formulas in Excel are in English. Also when I go to the settings (system preferences --> language and region --> apps) Excel is set to be using English language.
 
Alex: We definitely improved [the code] over time but to some extent, it would have required a complete rewrite to address some of the fundamental issues that are the legacy of being an overgrown prototype.
 
Overall, whilst a refactor and a possible port to a new platform is wildly overdue, the sheer amount of time that this spaghetti code has build up over makes it an immensely large job to do that may never get time allocated to.
 
I would agree with your statements. The sooner DECA starts working on reprogramming, the more easier it will be to transition the code into another programming language and have a stronger foundation for RotMG.
 
HTML5 is a programming language for websites, not games. The most they could do when changing the HTML5 code would be to change how the game was embedded into the website, but not the actual code of the game itself.
 
I just updated to 2020.2 and both Setchup and LO surprisingly changed to swedish eventhough I downloaded the english version. Did you find an answer to this? I am located in Sweden but I definetely dont want the swedish verson. Did you mean my whole system need to change region, isnt it up to me wich version I dowwnload, I mean why is there even an option in the download then?
 
Ok, found how to change it! There is a possibility to change the language for the actual program only in the systems control panel (Mac). Added both SU and LO and chose english and when I reopened now the english version is back. Skärmavbild 2020-08-12 kl. 20.06.51666516 31.5 KB

This month, high-performance language Rust jumped from position #17 to position #13 in the TIOBE index. This is an all time high for Rust. Gaining 4 positions might seem a small change, but Rust has been "the talk of the town" the last couple of years without making much progress in the TIOBE index. Rust is finally moving up. After the tailwind of the US government, which recently announced to recommend moving from C/C++ to Rust for security reasons, things are going fast for Rust. The community is growing, including the number of third party libraries and tools. In short, Rust is preparing itself for a top 10 position in the TIOBE index. --*Paul Jansen CEO TIOBE Software*
 
The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, courses and third party vendors. Popular web sitesGoogle, Amazon, Wikipedia, Bing and more than 20 others are used to calculate the ratings.It is important to note that the TIOBE index is not about the *best* programming language or the languagein which *most lines of code* have been written.
 
The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or to make a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting to build a new software system. The definition of the TIOBE index can be found here.
 
The complete top 50 of programming languages is listed below. This overview is published unofficially, because it could be the case that we missed a language. Ifyou have the impression there is a programming language lacking, please notify us at tpci@tiobe.com. Please also check the overview of all programming languages that we monitor.
 
We spent a lot of effort to obtain all the data and keep the TIOBE index up to date. In order to compensate a bit for this, we ask a fee of 5,000 US$ for the complete data set. The data set runs from June 2001 till today. It started with 25 languages back in 2001, and now measures more than 150 languages once a month. The data are available in comma separated format. Please contact sales@tiobe.com for more information.
 
In Visual Studio Code, we have support for almost every major programming language. Several ship in the box, for example, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and HTML but more rich language extensions can be found in the VS Code Marketplace.
 
In VS Code, you can enhance your coding with artificial intelligence (AI), such as suggestions for lines of code or entire functions, fast documentation creation, and help creating code-related artifacts like tests.
 
GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool that helps you write code faster and smarter. You can use the GitHub Copilot extension in VS Code to generate code, or to learn from the code it generates.
 
In VS Code, we default the language support for a file based on its filename extension. However, at times you may want to change language modes, to do this click on the language indicator - which is located on the right hand of the Status Bar. This will bring up the **Select Language Mode** dropdown where you can select another language for the current file.
 
A language identifier is often (but not always) the
