For instance, certain Volvo and Mack trucks will display active codes on the dashboard but when you plug in the diagnostic software the fault codes display as inactive. However, you must always take caution to check to see if you have an actual active fault code or an inactive fault code.

The inactive fault codes were once active at some point in time but now they are fixed, or they fixed themselves. The ECU goes through a verification check to see if the fault code has been fixed or not at each time the truck is powered on. Essentially, this is an internal self-test to ensure that the fault codes are or are not an existing problem.
 
We just had a call the other day with a customer who owns a 2019 Freightliner chassis with Cummins 6.7 ISB passenger bus. This customer was in a derate condition with active SCR inducement derate (5mph) fault codes. The Freightliner was taken into a dealer where ECU was reprogrammed in order to clear the active fault codes. However, after he left the dealer and approximately 150 miles later the Freightliner went back into an SCR inducement derate a.k.a. 5mph derate. It can be difficult to get down to the root cause of certain active fault codes, but it is imperative that you figure out what caused the fault code to occur in the first place to prevent the same issue from occurring again. There is a reason why this Freightliner chassis went into a derate again and knowing that would have ensured that the real problem was fixed.
 
You can use OTR Diagnostics to read your fault codes that appear on your vehicle directly on your mobile device. You'll be able to see enhanced fault code details, a description of your fault code, troubleshooting steps, fault symptoms, repair procedures, and the number of times a fault code has appeared.

Having the correct information about the fault codes can ensure that you will fix the right part the first time. Diagnosing a fault code takes time and patience. Especially if you are a technician or shop owner, it's important to have good spare parts to test on. Using good parts will validate the proper repair was performed. For instance, don't replace your engine ECU until it's checked it with another spare engine ECU to make sure that is indeed is the root problem.

I went to a shop last week to look at this truck, two codes were in the PCM and would not clear. The shop diagnosed the truck with a bad particulate sensor. The sensor was replaced and the code did not come back. The 3712 and 3714 codes however would not clear, and the engine was in derate mode. Below you can see the conditions for clearing the code:
 
Conditions for Clearing the Fault Code This fault code will go inactive once all other active fault codes have been addressed. Refer to the appropriate fault code troubleshooting tree. The ECM will turn off the red STOP ENGINE lamp immediately after the diagnostic runs and passes.
 
Conditions for Clearing the Fault Code This fault code will go inactive once all other active fault codes have been addressed. Refer to the appropriate fault code troubleshooting tree. The ECM will turn off the amber CHECK ENGINE lamp immediately after the diagnostic runs and passes.
 
A regen and SCR test was performed post repair. All of the temps looked perfect and it passed all of the tests. The 3712 and 3714 still would not go away, there were absolutely no other codes. I have experienced this before, my simple minded explanation is that the codes are latched and there is a software issue. I decided to reflash the computer to the latest calibration. The codes were gone and everything was back to normal. If a reflash was not available, I would have still flashed the computer like an install and that would probably have the same effect. None of the calibrations cited this as an issue, so it was just a matter of uninstalling and reinstalling software, just like a PC or phone. I hope this helps someone out someday.
 
Matthew based on my experience after running the scr test the codes should go from active to inactive after an extended idle for a minute or two once it goes inactive then you can clear the codes. The scr test has to pass of course.
 
The customer had some other codes that were active previously, and had already fixed the problem. However, the truck was still derated with the codes mentioned above and he wasn't sure how to fix it. The procedure:
 
Thank you, Tyler. Those two codes have turned a lot of my hairs grey! Where did you find that procedure? Here is something I posted in another forum a while back... just in case that doesn't work for someone.

I have my insight procedures pulled up and I can't find aftertreatment maintenance command found the rest of the procedures but not that step please help currently going through this issue at our shop
 
The Electronic Control Module (ECM) in the engine monitors all the readings constantly as the engine runs. If the values go over or drop under what is expected, then the ECM will log a fault code. There are three fault code statuses:
 
For example, the list of ISX fault codes without EGR prior to 2002 is a different list from the 2007 2010 ISX fault codes with DPF. For the former, the 111 fault code stands for Electronic Control Module. For the latter, 111 has a more specific error: ECM Critical Internal Failure.
 
These are some of the most common Cummins engine issues, but many other problems can crop up as well. The best way to keep any diesel engine in good shape is to follow recommended maintenance schedules to stay on top of preventative repairs and replacements.
 
Fuel filter intervals for the 24-valve are the same as the 6.7-liter, but 12-valve engines should have it replaced every 12,000 miles or 12 months, whichever comes first. These intervals remain unchanged even in severe operating conditions.

Depending on the year and engine configuration, it may be a little different or not possible, also be aware that if you have an active fault it WILL NOT clear or reset, if you have a Detroit DD series engine these are the procedures (split up by year of the truck):

We have around 25 hours on our 2020 22LSV. The warning 4236-Closed Loop High Bank 1 continues to keep coming on. My best guess is that it might be a bad O2 sensor, though unsure of how to replace. Any thoughts around this warning and wha
