I am having problems with Bluetooth on my pc not even being visible to turn off and on, it's not showing up in the device manager but if I go to & apps and features it shows there is a driver installed but nothing showing up. When I originally had my PC running on windows 11 my bluetooth was there and working since doing updates that DST has told me to do I performed the latest for my bluetooth to disappear completely.
 
I have a Intel(R) Wi-Fi 6E AX210 160MHz driver installed for my wireless however no matter what combination I have tried whether it was a fresh install of the drivers (removing them, restarting computer with no internet connection and then installing the drivers manually) which failed and the DST is showing my device drivers as up to date. I have also tried rolling back the driver which did not work and I really do not want to have to fresh rebuild my entire operating system already but I am getting to a loss on how to resolve this.

In this case, we would recommend first checking the BIOS settings in case there is an option related to the Bluetooth that might be disabled or Off. For this task, we recommend reviewing your computer's User Manual or contacting ASUS\* Support for proper assistance.
 
If such as Bluetooth setting is Enabled/On, we recommend trying a clean installation of both Bluetooth and Wireless drivers. The driver or software for your Intel component might have been changed or replaced by the computer manufacturer, therefore, we recommend trying this first with the customized drivers from **Asus\* website**. Please download and save the following drivers:
 
I have tried these steps however it seems that every time I uninstalled the driver it wouldn't remove, when it finally removed and stayed removed from the device manager I restarted and checked it hadn't reappeared which it had not, I tried to install the ASUS drivers to which did not even appear to install the devices whatsoever. It literally did nothing when trying to run and running it as administrator. I even restarted the computer to check they didn't need a restart.
 
I then tried the fresh install of the Intel drivers as advised as the secondary drivers to install. The Bluetooth driver seemed to install however is still not displaying in the device manager (please see attached screenshot of the device manager (this is set to show hidden devices too)) yet it shows installed on the Apps and features (please see attached apps & features) I then tried to reinstall the WIFI driver and it keeps failing to install and no longer lists the device in the device manager.

**4-** Check Device Manager, if you see entries regarding Wireless and Bluetooth, try to manually remove the drivers following the Clean installation articles: (if you don't see these entries, skip to the next step)
 
I tried the above as asked nether the less and still neither device works. Looking at my device manager now it appears that only one of my 2 ethernet ports are functioning properly too. (Please see attached ethernet port error.png).
 
I first of all disconnected from the internet and removed all the intel software listed above with discarding the settings (please see attached apps&features.png) I then rebooted the computer and opened device manager and removed all the wireless drivers and bluetooth drivers until they had completely disappeared and did not show up again. I then cleared all temporary files using check disk and the system temporary files too.
 
I then restarted my computer and attempted to install the ASUS drivers which did nothing, I then went into device manager and manually added the device driver which gave the following results (please see bluetoothinstall.png). I checked device manager and saw no bluetooth still but decided to try the wireless install which gave the following results (please see WI-FI install.png). however nothing appeared in the device manager after scanning for hardware changes still nothing so I restarted the computer.
 
I then opened device manager again and noticed that it has installed the device as a "network controller" listed under the other devices (please see attached Other.png) category. I then uninstalled this and repeated the process this time for the intel drivers to which has done the exact same and has now left my ethernet driver showing the above mentioned image ethernet port error.png
 
When you restarted the computer, did you have internet access completely disabled? If not, you are going to have Windows Update step in and install the same junk as before. You need to ensure this that you have no internet connection until after you have manually installed the various driver packages that you have downloaded.
 
After reviewing this, the best action is to contact the computer manufacturer (OEM) for more assistance since this seems to be related to hardware issues and may need a further inspection from your OEM. However, before that, you may try the following suggestions.
 
There is a good chance though that the card may just be burned out. I have to replace mine more than I should. It gets too hot sometimes. That model does not come with a heat sink so 80% shot that it fried itself. It happens but you shouldn't have to worry about it shorting out your PCI lane. Grab a replacement with maybe a heat sink or a fan or do what I do and install it under the graphics card fan to use it's cooling fan (yes, still warm but not hot) to regulate temps.

I have a Sengled lightbulb - bluetooth speaker (Pulse Solo C01-A66) that I paired with my Win 10 computer, but I can't get the computer to send the music signal to the speaker. What do I need to do to listen to music on it? The speaker works fine with my Android phone.
 
11-13(Alternate). If you do not see "Bluetooth AV", click "Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (Sink)" > Click "Properties" > Under "General" tab, click "Change Settings" > "Driver" tab > "Update Driver" > "Browse Computer" > "Let me pick from list..." > [Now you should see "Microsoft Bluetooth A2dp Source"] Click it > click "Next" > "Close"
 
PLEASE NOTE: It may be necessary to perform these actions each time you restart your PC until Microsoft fixes it (or maybe forever). However, I've found it to work just as well to skip steps 1-9 and go straight to the Devices and Printers tool.
 
But before you start troubleshoot this issue, have you make sure to set your Bluetooth Headset as default play back device, while the media player( which ever you're using) was running? Also, have you read the user manual? That can be somethimes very useful!
 
The missing step is to click on the Speaker icon in the "System Tray" (is it still called that?) at the bottom right corner of the screen. Above the volume slider is the name of the current output device, and to the right of that name is a ^ which you must click to select your Bluetooth device. This worked for me.
 
I had this happen to me. I had to go to **Settings > Devices > Bluetooth > More Bluetooth Options**, then make sure the **Allow bluetooth devices to find this PC** is checked.
 
Seems like a bug with the drivers, as of right now it looks like you can't use the mic and speaker for voice calls, have to use another mic while using these speakers. May have to contact JBL or Microsoft to report the issue.
 
There is one step you all are missing. After making sure the bluetooth speaker or headphone is paired with your computer and ready to connect open the windows 10 action center and you will see a panel that says.... connect. Click on that. Windows will search for your bluetooth device and ... connect to it.
 
Based on what @svinec said and despite Windows 7 not supporting Bluetooth 4.1 (my motherboard supports it), I updated my drivers from the Asus website, 'updated' the driver for the 'Generic Bluetooth Adapter' to 'Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4A Bluetooth 4.1', rebooted, installed the Asus drivers again and rebooted.
 
At this point I could see my JBL Charge 3 was showing blue, so it was now paired (before it would pair, but only show white). I removed the device, re-paired it and under playback devices in 'Sound' I found 'Speakers' listed as a 'Bluetooth Audio Device'. I set it as the default and sound now plays from the device.
 
To make bluetooth headphones appear as a Playback Device: I went to Control Panel, Hardware and Sound, Devices and Printers, right clicked my headphones, click Properties tab, click Services tab, check box for Audio Sink To Activate my headphones: Right click the speaker/sound icon in the bottom right menu, select Playback Devices, right click my headphones, check enable, click OK
 
Works great. Done. Trick was finding my headphones under Devices and Printers as previous poster mentioned - Thanks svinec. Glad I did not have to do as many updates as you, but also glad we both got our headphones working, thanks again!
 
A possible solution to Bluetooth speaker playback issue:) I tried all the steps listed in several posting forums with no success. I finally found a solution after 3 hours of investigating. 1st several forums suggest updating drivers... but do not specify which drivers to update i.e. the Bluetooth device? (eg. bose audio, sony driver for sony Bluetooth headphones etc.), or the windows driver?
 
\*\*\* For me the solution was updating the Bluetooth driver from LENOVO's website (the laptop/computer manufacture's website) once
