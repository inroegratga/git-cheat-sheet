I'm a little sad right now. It's winter in New York, and I just got back from my trip to Bermuda. I'm missing the beautiful views, amazing golf courses, and most of all my host for the entire trip - the Cambridge Beaches Resort & Spa.

If you've never visited Bermuda before, it's one of the most beautiful islands filled with some of the nicest people you'll ever meet. I've been fortunate to travel to places like Hawaii, The Carribean, and Southeast Asia - Bermuda is right there with all of them with its beaches and clear blue oceans. Best of all, it's only a 90-minute flight from JFK Airport, which makes it an ideal location for golfers on the East Coast.
 
I stayed at the Cambridge Beaches Resort with my wife for 6 nights while competing in the Gosling's Invitational tournament. I'll do my best to give you all an overview of why this is such a special destination. I didn't think I could top my trip to Cabot Links, but they're now neck and neck in my memory bank.
 
I'll also let you in on a little secret that most golfers don't know about. Bermuda's offseason runs from roughly November to April. While warmer destinations like Florida and the Caribbean consider this peak season and charge big dollars, you can snag some incredible deals on a golf vacation to Cambridge Beaches while the weather is still very pleasant. I'll give you some more info towards the end of the article.
 
Cambridge Beaches Resort & Spa is located on the western end of Bermuda, near the village of Somerset. For nearly 100 years it has been one of the top resorts on the island, and I quickly found out why.
 
Bermuda is a very small island stretching only 22 miles. As you can imagine, the land is at a premium. Most resorts there don't have a ton of space, but the thing that sets Cambridge Beaches apart is the size and location of their resort. The property is quite enormous and located on a peninsula that gives you clear views of the ocean no matter where you are standing. Many of the cottage-style accommodations have stunning views and give guests a very private experience.
 
The property also boasts 4 private beaches that get you up close and personal with the ocean. Their infinity pool overlooks a cove with Bermuda's light blue water that is so clear, you can see beautiful coral and fish swimming up close.
 
Overall, Cambridge Beaches is one of the most unique and beautiful resort properties I have ever stayed. It has all of the rustic charms from Bermuda's past but with modern amenities that make your stay a luxury experience. As soon as you step foot there you'll know what I'm talking about. Here is a gallery of some pictures I took on the property:
 
Since this is a golf site you probably want to know a little more about your golfing options on Bermuda. Many don't know it, but Bermuda is a great golf destination that probably doesn't get as much attention as it should.
 
While competing in the Gosling's Invitational I had a chance to play rounds at the Port Royal Golf Course and the Belmont Hills Golf Club. Both are within a 15 minutes drive of Cambridge Beaches. Port Royal was one of my favorite courses I have ever played and reminded me of rounds I played in Hawaii. It hosted the PGA Grand Slam of Golf from 2009-2014 and is arguably the island's most prestigious course.
 
Belmont Hills was an entirely different test. The short, winding layout was unlike anything I had ever seen. Several holes "Belmonted" me with their blind tee shots and narrow landing areas. It's a fun challenge with stunning views.
 
There are several other courses on the island including Turtle Hill, Tucker's Point, Ocean View, and the famed Mid Ocean Club (which is private). Clarence Hofheins, the General Manager of Cambridge Beaches, told me that the resort can arrange rounds at any course and include them in your package, even Mid Ocean Club.
 
Long story short, you've got plenty of amazing golf courses to choose from. In the offseason, you can have many of your rounds included in your resort fee at very competitive rates. So if you're looking for a quick golfing getaway during the late fall or winter, you can save some serious money rather than going to places like Arizona, Florida, or the Caribbean which are charging peak rates.
 
When you visit Cambridge Beaches you should prepare to eat well. Every morning there is a buffet breakfast (included in your rate) with every conceivable breakfast food you can think of. On the first morning, my wife and I were treated to clear blue skies and 75-degree weather while we ate our breakfast overlooking the cove.
 
While one of the restaurants on the property closes down during the offseason (Breezes), their main restaurant, Tamarisk stays open for lunch and dinner. We had several meals there and everything was absolutely delicious. There are other great restaurants in the area you can travel to if you want variety, but know that you don't need to leave the resort if you don't want to.
 
There is also a great bar and sitting area next to Tamarisk which feels like its taking you back in time to a cozy cottage. My wife and I enjoyed several games of checkers and also there were some late night drinking and fun stories with the ex-pro athletes from the Pro Players Tour.
 
One thing I can't stress enough is the service. From the second we checked in every single staff member was courteous, friendly, and made sure we were enjoying our stay from start to finish. Anyone who has traveled to Bermuda before knows this is a recurring theme on the island as they are some of the friendliest people you will ever meet. You can expect to have a first-class experience when you visit.
 
My wife and I had the good fortune of staying in one of the Superior Water View suites. It was an enormous, comfortable room with massive views of Mangrove bay out of every window. There are plenty of options to choose from on the property with almost 80 rooms available. You can expect to have a luxury experience in each of their rooms, which the majority of the TripAdvisor reviews attest to.
 
If that's not enough, there is also a high-end spa on the property. The Ocean Spa features an indoor pool, hot tub, fitness room, sauna, steam room, and a wide range of services including massages and beauty treatments.
 
I found myself in there almost every day relaxing after a round of golf in the hot tub or sauna. For significant others who are not playing golf, they can pamper themselves. My wife treated herself to a pedicure which was a luxury for her since she did not have our 5-year old and 2-year old in tow. I also got a relaxing massage one afternoon, which was a nice recharge from plenty of golf.
 
Despite having traveled to Bermuda before, I never thought about it as a golfing option in the winter. Since it is a semi-tropical island, the winter months still have average temperatures ranging from 60 to 70 degrees, but the humidity makes it feel a bit warmer. While you won't necessarily have a beach vaca
