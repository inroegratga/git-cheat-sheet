Primal Scream embraced this rebellious spirit, infusing their music with a raw energy and unfiltered emotion that captured the zeitgeist of the underground metal scene.

The Insight Timer app provides access to over 40,000 guided meditations of varying topics and lengths, either with or without music. Over 4500 mindfulness experts, psychologists, neuroscientists, and educators contribute to the library of guided meditations. In addition, the app includes music tracks of different genres (ambient, classical, drumming) as well as nature sounds.
 
**My experience:** The extensive library of available meditations provides something for everyone, but it can be overwhelming. Filtering by length, type of voice, background music, and other options helps narrow down the choices. I have also found that the variety of options opened up a new world to me. As a super fidgety seeker of mindfulness, I have always sought guided meditations to keep my mind from veering off into primal scream left field, and I also have avoided sessions with background music. I recently decided to give some of the music in the app a try, and, to my surprise, I discovered that Tibetan drums provide just the right aural space for unguided meditations.
