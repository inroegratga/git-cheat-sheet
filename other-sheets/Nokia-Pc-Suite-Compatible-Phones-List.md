The Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery System consists of three parts: the Pod, the Omnipod 5 App and the Dexcom G6\*. When you get started on Omnipod 5, you can access the Omnipod 5 App using the separate wireless Controller included in your first prescription or connect via a compatible smartphone.
 
**Android 12 Note**: For alarms/alerts to work as expected, do not use the Android Deliver Quietly feature introduced in Android 12. Enabling this feature will silence all Alerts/Alarms from the Omnipod 5 App, including critical alerts/alarms such as Urgent Low.
 
The Omnipod 5 App for iPhone has received FDA 510(k) clearance! Omnipod 5 will be the first tubeless automated insulin delivery (AID) system with full smartphone control from an iPhone or Android smartphone.
 
The Omnipod 5 App for iPhone is being tested for compatibility with a range of iPhone models that run iOS 17 and above. More information and a full compatibility list will be available once the Omnipod 5 App for iPhone is released on the App Store.

The Omnipod 5 App v1.2.1 for compatible smartphones became available on 5/22/23. The new release includes background updates aimed at improving the overall App functionality, including system communication. If an Omnipod 5 App error presents on the screen after completing the update, it can be cleared by tapping the OK button. You can continue use of your Omnipod 5 System and this will not impact insulin delivery or Pod functionality. If you continue to get this notification, please contact Customer Care at 1-800-591-3455.
 
An update to the Omnipod 5 App is now available in the Google Play Store. The new update addresses the communication issue between the Omnipod 5 App and Pod running on the Android 12 operating system. We recommend all phone control users update the Omnipod 5 App to the latest version [V1.0.92], regardless of whether you have experienced the issue.
 
If you are using your compatible personal smartphone to control the Omnipod 5 System and it breaks, becomes lost or stolen, you'll be able to switch to the Insulet-provided controller. You will need to start setup again on the provided controller.
 
At this time, users are unable to transfer settings from one device to another. Before starting Omnipod 5 using a new mobile device or Insulet provided controller, it is recommended that you upload your most recent Omnipod 5 data to Glooko. Within Glooko there is a settings sheet that will summarize your Omnipod 5 settings for you to input into your new device.
 
The mobile device compatibility list will be updated on a regular basis as new compatible smartphone models are available. Users are encouraged to visit www.omnipod.com/compatibility for smartphone model compatibility updates.
 
Before the first time using the Omnipod 5 App on your smartphone, you will need to first login to the provided Omnipod 5 Controller with your Omnipod ID. If you do not have an Omnipod ID, you can go to www.omnipod.com/setup to create an ID. Once you have established an Omnipod ID, walk through the login steps on the provided Omnipod 5 Controller. This initial login on the Controller will establish your account and you can now login to the Omnipod 5 App on your phone with the same Omnipod ID. This is a one-time process required before using the Omnipod 5 App for the first time.
 
The Omnipod 5 App has been optimized and should not have an impact on your smartphone's battery life. The Omnipod 5 Pod and Dexcom G6 CGM are in continuous communication but the mobile app only wakes and checks for Pod status periodically using Bluetooth low energy which is designed to not drain the battery. In addition, internet connection is only established on-demand when certain functionality, like update checks are needed, and therefore is used infrequently and should not impact smartphone battery life.
 
We have designed the Omnipod 5 App so that you can use your phone as intended while receiving continuous insulin therapy. For example, you do not need to stay in the App while a bolus is being delivered or while you have the Activity feature in use. It is, however, advised that you complete your intended task, such as a bolus or basal changes, by verifying the confirmation message on your screen before leaving the app.
 
The Omnipod 5 App relies on some of your smartphone's settings to function. The tables below outline the required and recommended settings to ensure the Omnipod 5 System works as intended. To change your settings on an Android phone, find the Settings app, and then tap the gear icon labeled Settings.
 
The Omnipod 5 System is safe to use at atmospheric pressures typically found in airplane cabins during flight. Always check your glucose frequently during flying. Though the Omnipod 5 System is safe to use at atmospheric pressures typically found in airplane cabins during flight, the atmosphere pressure in an airplane cabin can change during flight, which may affect the Pod's insulin delivery. The Omnipod 5 App sends and receives information from the Pod using Bluetooth wireless technology. Before flying, check your airline's policy regarding the use of Personal Medical Electronic Devices that communicate using Bluetooth technology. If use of a Personal Medical Electronic Device using Bluetooth technology is allowed, set your Omnipod 5 App to airplane mode while on the airplane. The Bluetooth setting remains enabled in the controller's airplane mode so you can communicate with your Pod. Airplane Mode is a device setting that will turn off cellular and Wi-Fi network connectivity but keep Bluetooth active. If you are using your smartphone, make sure to check that Bluetooth is enabled after you turn ON Airplane mode. ALWAYS keep the Bluetooth setting ON. If you turn this setting OFF, you will not be able to use the Omnipod 5 App.
 
The Omnipod 5 App has been designed to ensure safe and secure communication with the Pod. The app ensures that you must first login to start using the app. The app is verified through Insulet's cloud using the industry standard certificate. Every communication between the Pod and Omnipod 5 App is encrypted and goes through a series of verifications to ensure that only the trusted Omnipod 5 App can communicate with the Pod. As a result, all aspects of the communication between the app, Pod, and the cloud are protected from security threats.
