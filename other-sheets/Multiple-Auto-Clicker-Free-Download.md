As there are multiple mouse locations tp be configured, the Multiple Mouse Clicker allows to select any of the Screen Co-Ordinates using a prebuilt System Wide Keyboard Shortcut. As displayed in the figure, currently the F6 key combination is in use to get the screen location. In order to get the Screen Location to be clicked, just move the mouse cursor to the desired position and press the F6 shortcut key. In case the function key F6 is already in use by some other software, the Multiple Mouse Clicker will try to grab hold of other function keys such as F7, F8 and F9. Once you have configured the mouse clicks, hide it to system tray and whenever you want the mouse clicks to be simulated automatically, just press the configured shortcut key combination and the software will do the clicks for you.

\* Multiple auto-type sequences can now be defined for a window in one entry.  
\* The auto-type entry selection dialog now displays the sequence that will be typed.  
\* Items in the auto-type entry selection dialog can now be selected using a single click.  
\* When performing global auto-type, the Spr engine now uses the entry container database instead of the current database as data source.
 
Nice work! I gave this a quick test yesterday and it all seemed to work fine. I tested a few different sites, as well as PICKCHARS and it worked as expected. I like the new dialogue box with one click too, and the ability to see the autotype string - essential now 1 entry can have multiple auto types for the same window.
 
Not sure if this would be an improvement or not, but in the new auto type window that pops up, is it possible to group each entry into an expanding list? Might not be an issue straight away, but if a user has lots of entries for the same window in multiple entries, the list in the auto type might be quite long and hard to navigate? Obviously, the only problem with this is the extra clicking etc needed when autotype has been invoked.
 
I guess usually people will have very few multiple sequences for a window (e.g. for two different login pages or something). Anyway, power users indeed might have long lists, and grouping like you suggested could be useful. I'll maybe add this later as an option; added it to my to-do list.
 
I tried the new multiple auto-type sequence and selection feature out on a multiple page bank login that occasionally inserts security questions in between the username & password pages. It worked nicely. I did find it was a bit of a challenge to distinguish the various entries in the selection dialog based on auto-type sequence because my default auto-type prepends DELAY=4HOME+END to every auto-type. It was necessary to widen the selection field to see the differences in auto-type sequence. (If I eliminated the DELAY=4 I could see just enough of the sequences to distinguish them). I can see where some folks may really like being able to keep all the auto-type sequence variations for a site in a single entry.
 
For myself, I will probably continue to use multiple entries and field references to manage login page variations because I find that entering a descriptive name in the Entry's Title produces a selection dialog in which it is easy to distinguish auto-type sequence variants. The new Duplication Options have just made this method hugely more convenient!
 
I think the default dialog size should be suitable for most users. Anyway, if your auto-type sequences start with a long, common prefix, then distinguishing the items can indeed become hard. Of course you can point on the items and look at the tooltips, but that's not really convenient.
 
I've enhanced the dialog: it's resizable now; KeePass remembers the dialog's position, size and the list view column widths. So, users working with large auto-type sequences just need to layout the dialog once as they wish.
 
I even thought that perhaps version 2.17 just is not coded right in the 'about' information and is incorrectly displaying 2.16 ( so that I really am running 2.17 and just don't know it). but when I go to the autotype tab of an entry, it looks just like it did in version 2.16. There is nothing new for support of multiple sequences for a window in one entry, so I must really be running 2.16.
 
From that point, it will be nice to have access to the password generator function derive from previous password, save entry and copy password to clipboard (because the user has to change the password first, before he can use the Auto-type for the new generated password)
 
I update the version number only for official releases. So, all development snapshots after the official release 2.16 will also show 2.16 as version; all after the official 2.17 will still show 2.17, etc. If you want to know what development snapshot you're using, look at the last modification time of the KeePass.exe file.
 
Also, I highly recommend to unpack development snapshots to new folders, not into the folder of a previous KeePass version. Development snapshots might be very unstable and you might lose all your data, so you should only test it with a testing database, never with your real one.
 
The situation that you want to use an expired entry in the auto-type entry selection dialog theoretically shouldn't occur. People who use passwords that expire often will typically enable the option to show soon-to-expire passwords at KeePass startup. If we assume that the KeePass database is opened regularly, users will change the passwords at this point of time. Thus, for the auto-type entr
