I immediately thought it was a mix of Angels Share and By The Fireplace and fortunately for me, that scent profile stays throughout duration of the wear. It's a beautiful mix of vanilla and amber with a hint of incense and rum to break up the sweetness and add some character.  
  
It's not as thick and strong as I'd like (like my beloved Grand Soir) but it's such an enjoyable wear that I can excuse the moderate performance. I don't get the play dough vibe that lots of people are picking up on, thankfully. For the price I paid for this, I'm over the moon. An extremely successful blind buy!  
  
UPDATE   
  
I could still smell this on my skin after 12 hours. It doesn't project strongly but the performance is still fantastic.
 
I'm not into gourmand scent but Andalusian soul has my heart.its cozy warm vanilla .its sweet but not sickly sticky sweet .it mixed with smoky note from incense and herbs notes to make differentiation from any vanilla body mists.if absolute aphrodisiac says"eat me now".Andalusian soul says"you want me but not tonight"...

It's pleasant but performs rather poorly on my skin and doesn't project at all. The opening is quite nice with the rum note but the dry down is boring to my hardened gourmand lover's nose. I'm afraid I expected something a lot more fiery and memorable from a fragrance called Andalusian Soul. I'm glad I got a decant first.
 
A very pleasant creation.   
First off however, it is a bit like you were at a campsite next to the campfire.. That incense is smokey!   
However, once that dies down the dry down is beautiful, vanilla, rum, powdery, very sweet scent but with depth. It's well balanced for sure. I get the play dough referenced, but it's a very nice smelling play dough! The perfume is on the more sophisticated end, I would not recommend it to the beach for example, maybe later to the beach party! Definitely not an everyday daytime kind of perfume. I can more imagine it to a work dinner or a bar event.
 
All Merchant of Venice was super cheap at Max Aroma last weekend so wait for MOV to go on sale when you purchase them because I got my bottles like 1/2 off.  
  
Sold out at Max Aroma currently for FB's but you can get this as a decant from them right now and I love their decants. They come in a leather like bottle perfect for travel and they are reusable.  
  
This scent, so good. It's pretty much niche Warm Vanilla Sugar from BBW. Totally safe blind buy, given you like vanilla. I don't get much other than a really great, straight-forward warm vanilla perfume. I've been looking for a good warm vanilla and I think I found it with Andalusian Soul. Wait till MOV goes on sale before buying Andalusian though. Unfortunately, it's very popular and also sold out, frequently. I wish it performed better, though.
 
I just received this yesterday, and will let it macerate for a while. I did spray it right away though, and all I've got is \*Warm Vanilla Sugar from B&BW. It's practically the same, just packed in fancy bottle. I know DemiR is hyping it big time, but seriously..nothing to write home about. It's just amber vanilla, pretty straight forward. It's not a bad fragrance per se, it's cozy, sweet and inoffensive..but it's just like WVS.
 
This is sweetened rhum + honeyed floral vanilla&caramel!! Velvety but light at the same time, gorgeous scent, no one can hate or dislike this one but at the same time this is very much a niche & a high quality perfume. This is a beautiful all-year rounder and is signature worthy, i can also see this as a perfect wedding scent or an indulgent bedtime scent . Expensive smelling for a discounted price i got it. Comforting, cozy, happy scent. This is a hidden gem :)

This will be my next full bottle purchase. I love this! It has the same classy vibe as Gentle Fluidity Gold and Grand Soir. It's not a huge projector but I think if it was, it would be too much. Such a beautiful ambery vanilla. And you can't beat the prices this goes for on the gray market! Love ?
 
Oh yes this is lovely ? I am immediately reminded of the honey note in Teriaq but to my surprise there is no honey listed here. And I do understand the dried banana scent that people are mentioning below. Honey and bananas? --> Yes, please.   
  
The fragrance is lighter, but the scent itself is so lovely that I am still ok with it. It may be one I'll have to overspray a little bit or maybe it is better for cooler spring/summer nights. I will also try some layering combinations and see what works best. Overall it's a win.   
  
If you enjoy Teriaq chances are you will enjoy this too. And vice-versa. They are not nearly the same but that honeyed-caramel very similar in each. Blind buy success.
 
Oh such a lovely warm scent! Not a winter perfume at all although It's a caramel amber sweet but not loud. The bottle and the name really suits it. It's not the typical vanila scent. It's really interesting indeed. I can smell the labdanum and some slight boozy note. Someone mentioned earlier dried bananas. Yes, exactly, like there is a bit of a rum in there with a tropical flavour (dried bananas, papaya and caramel). No worries guys, no animals here! I wished it could last longer on my skin but 4-5 hours isn't that bad.
 
Interesting scent. Opens up very smoky and boozy and dries down to a boozy, powdery vanilla, smoky scent with some florals in the back. The smoke is somewhat too heavy and spoils the balance of the notes. Feminine leaning in my opinion.
 
Is it just me guys or does this smell exactly like The Body Shop Vanilla body mist?  
  
Edit- Okay so after testing, It has similarities but not exactly similar per se. Tbs vanilla body mist is more linear, and while this is not complex, it has some sort of depth because of the rum note I guess?  
  
It is quite cosy, I just wish the performance was better. Love love spraying it on my sweater and lounging around!
 
For me this perfume smells a lot like... coconut. I have very mixed feelings about the merchant of Venice. At the same time that the fragrances are quite gourmand and interesting, they smell very synthetic. like a cheap perfume that imitates something fancy... but for a fancy price! Overall this fragrance reminds me of going to a caff after a beach day and jazz plays on the background... but after a while it only smells like amber, acacia and vanilla. As soon as it gets sprayed it smells interesting, but fades fast... however this vanilla, acacia and amber with a coconuty hint stay. and it's nice, but seems like a body-splash smell to me. also the performance of this perfume is similar to the one of a body-splash.
 
This is a great example how people's opinions are dictated by the official pyramid. Rhum and Acacia might make sense, but Incense, herbs and Civet will take your imagination (if you have not smelled it yet) into a wrong direction.   
For me, this perfume is a gourmand Vanilla Amber with a tropical vibe. I think I even get Coconut (maybe coconut Rhum?) and dried bananas (not banana fruit, not chips, but the sticky dried bananas). And lots of sweetness in between: caramel, maple syrup, honey. It's edible, dense, yet not cloying and well balanced.   
Also, I do not know so many perfumes that do Vanilla so well. It's voluptuous and expanding.

Few houses, if any at all, produce bottles that look quite as beautiful, or as elegant, as the ones from the Murano and Murano Exclusive collection from The Merchant of Venice. I don't usually comment on presentation, since it rarely has any impact on the fragrance itself, however there is a deeper reason today than just the fact that they look truly stunning. The scent in question today, Andalusian Soul, comes in a gorgeous glass bottle with shades of orange, red and yellow, evoking a warmth and brightness, that perfectly suits the fragrance itself, reminiscent of the golden Mediterranean sun!  
  
Andalusian Soul opens with a powerfully boozy rum accord, but not a commonplace rum. The rum accord is deep, dark and sweet, a rum that has has been aged perfectly for decades in an oak barrel, and now has a deliciously heady aroma. The rum is joined by the lightest honeyed-floral acacia note and a touch of amber, just enough to give balance to the rum, while simultaneously giving it further depth of character. However, that's not all. There is a clear backbone of vanilla, flitting through the top notes, giving it a warmth, that blooms as the fragrance progresses.   
  
As the top notes fade, the acacia departs, and the amber and rum settle into their role as a supporting character, the true star of the fragrance takes center-stage. And it is here, in the mid, that my favorite part of this olfactory experience begins. The vanilla, that earlier was whispering, flirting through the veil of the top notes, now blooms in full. The vanilla is full bodied, decadent, and incredibly warm and cozy. And it takes Andalusian Soul from a beautiful booze-forward fragrance, to a wonderfully gourmand scent. In the mid, the vanilla mixes with a light dusting of sage and rosemary, but rather than taking on an herbal quality, it takes on a interestingly baked character! The mid, which on paper should smell like an herbal vanilla, instead comes across as a delicious butterscotch and biscuit combination, and it does this without entering the dangerous territory of cloying, thanks to it's superb blending and balance.   
  
As the fragrance progresses to the dry down, it becomes a more traditional vanilla, with the lightest civet in the background, giving it a lovely intrigue, and a sensual quality. Here, in t
