"Thank you for hearing your customers on pricing and producing new strains! Excellent - Orange Ghost & Mimosa!! Staff have been top notch, professional, and great vibes - staff are engaging and seem to work together. Love the new Dimond location - easy access, great parking, and super convenient on my way home!"

"13/10 would recommend anyone to come to GNC. I've had a different person help me out each time I've gone in and they were always super nice. They always have the best strains, flower/pre-roll/oils, all of it is pretty great. And when they don't have your favorite in stock, they'll have the next best thing! For sure my go-to when I need more stuff."

The effects of these treatments are well-studied and typically well-tolerated for their intended use. However, using cannabis products outside of their prescribed use or using cannabis from unlicensed distributors can carry great risk.

Some people use CBD oil to reduce or replace their intake of prescription pain medications. Furthermore, a 2017 review suggests that using cannabis may help people with alcohol or opioid dependencies treat their addictions.
 
While research into the efficacy of medicinal cannabis as a treatment for psychiatric disorders is promising, it is still in its early stages. Further research is required to fully assess the role of medicinal cannabis in treating mental health conditions.
 
Evidence suggests that oral cannabinoids are effective against nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, and some small studies have found that smoked cannabis may also help alleviate these symptoms.
 
There is evidence that demonstrates both the harms and health benefits of cannabis. Yet despite increasing studies in the area, more research is needed to determine the public health implications of rising cannabis use fully.
 
However, there is an obstacle to this: Cannabis is classed as a Schedule I controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Administration, which imposes strict conditions on the researchers working in this area.
 
Cannabis sativa has been cultivated for both its psychoactive properties (marijuana) and as a source of fiber (hemp). Both cultivars, marijuana and hemp, are the same plant - Cannabis sativa. Tennessee has legalized the cultivation of hemp and defined hemp as Cannabis sativa containing less than 0.3% THC. Marijuana, Cannabis sativa containing greater than 0.3% THC, is still illegal in Tennessee.
 
TBI, and other crime labs, have historically performed plant material testing by microscopically looking for unique botanical characteristics and performing a color test for compounds exclusive to Cannabis sativa. This historic testing is relatively quick and inexpensive.
 
Tennessee is on the leading edge of developing crime laboratory methodology to cope with this challenge and is one of few states currently performing THC quantitation on plant material in a state crime lab. We were assessed in THC quantitation by our laboratory accrediting body (ANAB) in July 2019 and expect to receive accreditation for the TBI Nashville Crime Lab in THC quantitation by the end of 2019.
 
TBI currently uses a three-step testing protocol. (See more below). TBI, like other crime labs, has historically performed plant material testing by microscopically looking for unique botanical characteristics and performing a color test for compounds exclusive to Cannabis sativa. This historic testing is relatively quick and inexpensive.
 
We perform a second color test to estimate the THC to CBD ratio. Marijuana has a high ratio of THC to CBD (typically 9:1 or greater) and will turn the second color test blue. Hemp has a lower ratio of THC to CBD and will turn the second color test red.
 
Essentially, hemp has a high amount of CBD and a very small amount of THC. Marijuana has a large amount of THC and a relatively small amount of CBD. The color test used in TBI's crime laboratories indicates the difference between the two based upon that ratio, but does not indicate the actual percentages.
 
**Presumptive Testing**
In addition to traditional microscopic analysis and color test, TBI performs a second color test to estimate the THC-to-CBD ratio. Marijuana has a high ratio of THC to CBD (typically 9:1 or greater) and will turn the second color test blue. Hemp has a lower ratio of THC to CBD and will turn the second color test red.

 
From 2005 to 2018, the statewide TBI Crime Laboratory Forensic Chemistry Unit identified plant material as marijuana an average of 9,951 times each year. This number has been relatively consistent over the years.
 
Additionally, the statewide TBI Crime Laboratory Forensic Chemistry Unit separately identified THC 497 times in 2018. THC is typically identified in samples that are not plant material, such as food stuffs, vape cartridges, oils, etc. THC identification has increased dramatically from 2005 to 2018.
 
Marijuana refers to the dried leaves, flowers, stems, and seeds from the Cannabis sativa or Cannabis indica plant. The plant contains the mind-altering chemical THC and other similar compounds. Extracts can also be made from the cannabis plant (see "Marijuana Extracts").
 
According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, cannabis (marijuana) is one of the most used drugs in the United States, and its use is widespread among young people. In 2021, 35.4% of young adults aged 18 to 25 (11.8 million people) reported using marijuana in the past year.1 According to the Monitoring the Future survey, rates of past year marijuana use among middle and high school students have remained relatively steady since the late 1990s. In 2022, 30.7% of 12th graders reported using marijuana in the past year and 6.3% reported using marijuana daily. In addition, many young people also use vaping devices to consume cannabis products. In 2022, nearly 20.6% of 12th graders reported that they vaped marijuana in the past year and 2.1% reported that they did so daily.2
 
Legalization of marijuana for medical use or adult recreational use in a growing number of states may affect these views. Read more about marijuana as medicine in our DrugFacts: Marijuana as Medicine.
 
People can mix marijuana in food (edibles), such as brownies, cookies, or candy, or brew it as a tea. A newly popular method of use is smoking or eating different forms of THC-rich resins (see "Marijuana Extracts").
 
These extracts can deliver extremely large amounts of THC to the body, and their use has sent some people to the emergency room. Another danger is in preparing these extracts, which usually involves butane (lighter fluid). A number of people have caused fires and explosions and have been seriously burned from using butane to make extracts at home.3,4
 
When a person smokes marijuana, THC quickly passes from the lungs into the bloodstream. The blood carries the chemical to the brain and other organs throughout the body. The body absorbs THC more slowly when the person eats or drinks it. In that case, they generally feel the effects after 30 minutes to 1 hour.
 
Marijuana also affects brain development. When people begin using marijuana as teenagers, the drug may impair thinking, memory, and learning functions and affect how the brain builds connections between the areas necessary for these functions. Researchers are still studying how long marijuana's effects last and whether some changes may be permanent.
 
For example, a study from New Zealand conducted in part by researchers at Duke University showed that people who started smoking marijuana heavily in their teens and had an ongoing marijuana use disorder lost an average of 8 IQ points between ages 13 and 38. The lost mental abilities didn't fully return in those who quit marijuana as adults. Those who started smoking marijuana as adults didn't show notable IQ declines.5
 
The amount of THC in marijuana has been increasing steadily over the past few decades.7 For a person who's new to marijuana use, this may mean exposure to higher THC levels with a greater chance of a harmful reaction. Higher THC levels may explain the rise in emergency room visits involving marijuana use.
 
The popularity of edibles also increases the chance of harmful reactions. Edibles take longer to digest and produce a high. Therefore, people may consume more to feel the effects faster, leading to dangerous results.
 
The Food and Drug Administration has alerted the public to hundreds of reports of serious lung illnesses associated with vaping, including several deaths. They are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to investigat
