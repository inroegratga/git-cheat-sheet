First things first. With a single USB cable connecting FANTOM to your DAW, it becomes a keyboard controller and a 163 stereo audio interface. What that means is that all 16 channels and Zones can go directly to the computer multitrack. It can also send six channels out.

Hi, hope someone can help me? Right, I have Cubase 10.5 pro, Fantom xr sound module, Apollo twin usb interface, Midi keyboard. How can I use, record get sound etc from this set up? Bare in mind, drivers for the sound module etc are not working with current cubase. Hope that makes sense lol. I just wana be able to hear sound from module, record midi & bounce audio file with sound from module.
 
Hey you,
I am wondering what you exactly tried - maybe with more detail we could still help.
I think you maybe dont need the Roland driver at all, because your audio is going from the sound module to the audio interface. Does sound reach cubase this way?
What you need is a midi connection from your computer to the sound module - which maybe works without the driver over usb anyways. Or the apollo has a midi out - then you could connect this with the roland sound module. The audio-path in your case would be via the apollo and so no fantom driver needed for this.
So: Is it clear what the problem actually is currently? No midi-connection? No audio? If the apollo has no midi connectors a cheap midi interface (class compliant, so no special driver needed) would do the job in case the midi connection directly to the fantom is not working because of the lacking driver support.
 
Thank you for sticking with me! Ok! I have got a midi usb cable now. Connected to the fantom IN, usb side connected to pc. A jack cable from fantom OUT to apollo interface. (Mic 2, line IN) cubase, added midi track with all midi inputs & output as (usb interface) Which is my usb cable connected to fantom. Added a audio track with (Mic 2 line IN) as input. Enable monitor etc. P.s audio signal sound Very bad. Nothing! Lol. If i hit keys on my nektar midi keyboard i can see activity on midi channel. What am i doing wrong?

Hi you,
ok - so your cubase midi track is receiving midi data from your nektar, right? And the midi output of this track is routed to the sound module (via your new usb midi). Have you enabled midi through in the cubase settings (program settings/midi) and did you enable the monitor button on the midi track?
 
Hi Elien, thanks for your replys checking rite now. Quick one, do you know the Apollo twin usb interface? Should i plug my line IN from fantom to front, which is a guitar line or at rear which is mic. I already of a mic plugged in at rear so one more free. Also if you can check the fantom. Just incase im pluging it in wrong. Thanks. P.s i cant post a video on here can i? Just find it hard sometimes to put things into words
 
P.s just tested the demo songs with headphones sound is there! Also can hear demo song via apollo, speakers to. Also i can hear demo on cubase audio channel inserted & record sound. So at the mo its playing keys, instruments i cant hear
 
Hi you,
I dont know the apollo interface, but it is obvious that your audio connections are ok. Otherwise you would not hear the demo songs. So there has to be something wrong with your midi connections. Yesterday you succeeded in sending midi from your keybaord to cubase. So the issue seems to be with the midi connection from your computer to the fantom module. As far as I understood you used your midi usb cable for sending the signal from your computer to the fantom. I assume there are TWO midi (DIN) connectors on this cable. Did you use the right one to plug into the fantom?
And: Dont forget to enable midi through in cubase (program settings) and enable monitoring (the little brownish button with the speaker icon).
 
I suggest that you create screenshots that show your midi connections in the studio setup window and a screenshot that shows your midi track (inspector open with the midi in and out visible).
You are absolutely close to a solution I think. Maybe you can also tell us what usb midi cable you use!

Sorry none of Casio products have audio interface capability. While I understand some practical reasons for it, it can also be very tricky and unpractical depending on what computer system you're on as example. Mac can handle a combination of audio interfaces in an aggregate device. On Windows, not so much. Our instruments instead offer .wav file recording to a USB thumb drive. In the case of a PX-S7000, the thumb drive isn't even needed you can record digitally internally without having stop and plug anything in, then transfer that recording afterwards. We feel this is a faster way to capture that moment of inspiration without technology, cables and software getting in the way.
 
The PX-S6000/PX-S7000 are physically larger and heavier in comparison due to the speaker system and overall design. The PX-S5000 provides the new action in the most accessible and portable combination. Due to the physical differences in the chassis, the PX-S7000 and PX-S6000 will have a quieter action than the PX-S5000 but mechanically it is the same.
 
you're assuming we want to record. even my lowly yamaha p-145 piano lets you connect an ipad with only one usb cable and playback the audio (i.e. VB3x or VB3m with drawbars), through the piano's speakers. no muss, no fuss and no extra ad/da conversions. that's kind of a dealbreaker for me.
 
I'd tend to agree. But, surprisingly, Dexibell added that to their existing boards in their "AquqViva OS 4.0"update! But yeah, in most cases, I think it's much more likely that the existing hardware wouldn't support it.
 
Maybe this is the best place for a shameless plug! Our now not-so-new new video at is a 40 minute adaptation of T. S. Eliot's "Prufrock" - check it out! And hopefully I'll have something new here this year. ;-)
 
that's what the ipad/iphone is for . i pick the poison yamaha. The house keyboard at a jam we host mondays in NYC has a p-125. When i play it, I just plug my phone in via USB and boom, VB3m organ comes out of the yammy instead of the dreadful p-125 organ. Recently, somebody wanted to play some song i never heard of. Plugged in earbuds to the yammy, youtubed the song on my phone whilst connected to p-125, and figured it out, hearing both piano and youtube together in the buds, all whilst on stage 5 mins prior to hit. ymmv, but i find the audio interface super handy just for that alone.

Not to belabor a point, but AnotherScott described an implementation that he has suggested to various companies as an ideal way to implement an audio interface (Numa X Piano thread). You being someone who influences decisions for feature implementation, I thought this was worth the consideration.
 
The MODX/Montage and Fantom-0/Fantom are really good at this [seamlessly integrating an audio interface]... in fact, implementing it in a way I had suggested to some reps of a couple of other companies many years ago. Those companies didn't do it, but Yamaha and Roland did!
 
I will be using the word "program" to refer to a single complete sound... Korg and Kurzweil typically call these things Programs, other boards may call them other things, like Voices, Tones, Patches, or Parts).
 
So let's say you created a "Jump" patch in your OB-xD app. You'd create a program in your keyboard that consisted of a name (e.g. "Jump OB-xD"), the Program Change that needed to be sent to your iPad which would recall that sound, the Channel that Program Change needs to be sent over, and the category (e.g. "Synth"). Then when you call up your Synth category on your keyboard, you would see all the board's available internal Synth programs as usual (factory or user), but you would also see your externally available ones, selectable just as easily as the internal ones. So then you could select (and mix-and-match) your internal and external sounds with equal ease, with no apparent distinction between them.
