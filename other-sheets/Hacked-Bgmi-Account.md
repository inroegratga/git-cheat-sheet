My Xfinity email account has been hacked several times over the past year. The last time (5 months ago) and yesterday, the hackers were able to use the email account to gain access to my Dropbox account. 

Last time, I enabled 2-factor security in Dropbox with both a mobile authenticator app and physical security keys.

Yesterday, my Dropbox password was hacked and changed... 

I knew it was happening because I was aware that my email was being hacked and was literally dealing with it as it was happening. 

I realized that my Dropbox password was changed and I immediately changed it again. I WAS asked for 2-factor verification using the mobile app. I might have been asked for the security key, too - I don't remember exactly as I was dealing with several things at once. Point is that I WAS asked for something 2-factor to authenticate and allow the password change to occur.

What I find troubling is that "they" were able to change the password/gain access to my account with 2-factor in place... Isn't that the whole point of having 2-factor? A physical "key" which you must be in possession of in order to make certain changes to the account??? 

I chatted with Luis in Customer Support - absolutely NO HELP WHATSOEVER - basically stated "no idea how that happened" and said that the problem was probably my computer's security or that I had used public wifi... Public wifi never happened. I pressed him to escalate the case or forward it to a security team (does that even exist??). He asked to move the chat to email - I suspect as a way to get rid of me..

Any info / advice would be appreciated. Thanks for your time.

Before we can help you with your hacked Activision account, please select **My account was hacked** below. From there, we will ask you to provide additional details to help us recover your hacked Activision account.
 
**Since you're unable to log in to the account you need help with, you will need to create a temporary Activision account to submit an account recovery request. You will also need to link a PlayStation, Xbox, Steam, or Battle.net account that was previously linked to your hacked Activision account.

After you've changed your password, we recommend enabling two-factor authentication (if it's not already enabled). Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your account by requiring you to enter a code from a second device when you sign in.
 
Another way to protect yourself from hackers is to ensure that your software is always up-to-date. This includes your operating system, web browser, antivirus software, and any other programs you use.
 
Outdated software can have security vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit to gain access to your account. Keeping your software up-to-date can help close these security holes and make it harder for hackers to get into your account.
 
Messages in this situation serve two purposes: to inform people of what happened and to provide directions on how to protect themselves. Being brief and apologetic will allow them to quickly turn their attention to the necessary steps, such as remaining vigilant.

There are several reasons why you might lose access to your PUBG account. One of the most common reasons is forgetting your login credentials, such as your username or password. Another reason could be that your account has been hacked or compromised, and someone else has taken control of it. In some cases, PUBG might ban your account due to cheating or other violations of its terms and conditions.
 
Perhaps the most frustrating reason for losing your PUBG Mobile account is when you get hacked or scammed. This can happen when you click on suspicious links or download third-party apps that claim to enhance your PUBG experience. Unfortunately, these apps can contain malware or viruses that can steal your login information and compromise your account.
 
If you suspect that you have lost access to your PUBG account, there are a few signs to look out for. If you cannot log in with your usual credentials, that could indicate that your account has been hacked or compromised. You might also receive notifications that your account has been logged in from an unfamiliar device or location. If you notice any unusual activity on your account, such as purchases or changes to your settings that you did not make, this could also be a sign of a hacked account.
 
**Step 6:** Tap submit and wait for the PUBG Mobile team to review your account recovery request. They will review your account and contact you via email with further instructions on how to recover your account. This process takes about 14 days on average, so be patient and make sure to check your email regularly.
 
**Step 7:** Once you receive the email from the PUBG team, follow the instructions carefully to recover your account. This may involve resetting your password or verifying your identity through additional steps.
 
There you have it! These are the steps you need to follow to recover your PUBG Mobile account if it has been hacked. Remember that as soon as your account is recovered, all previously linked login methods will be disabled, so make sure you provide the correct email when answering the recovery form.
 
You can also enable two-factor authentication by linking your mobile number to your account. This provides an extra layer of security on your PUBG Mobile account and ensures that only you can access your account, even if someone else knows your password.
 
Getting hacked and losing access to your PUBG mobile account can be a frustrating and stressful experience. However, by taking proactive measures to protect your account and staying aware of potential security threats, you can minimise the risk of being hacked. In the event that your account is compromised, act quickly to recover it and follow the tips we have provided to prevent future incidents. Remember to always prioritize the security of your account and stay safe while enjoying your PUBG Mobile gameplay.
 
WhatsApp is a widely used messaging app and video chat app that prioritizes user privacy and security. However, concerns about potential hacking and unauthorized access to WhatsApp accounts may arise. If you suspect that your WhatsApp account has been compromised, it's crucial to take immediate action. This ultimate guide will provide you with essential insights and steps to help you determine if your WhatsApp account has been hacked.
 

A hacked WhatsApp account may exhibit unusual battery drain or increased data usage. Malicious software or spyware installed on your device could be running in the background, causing these anomalies. Monitor your device's battery usage and data consumption to identify any irregularities.
 

Pay attention to any unusual pop-up messages or permission requests that appear while using WhatsApp. Legitimate apps typically don't ask for unnecessary permissions. If you encounter suspicious requests, it could be a red flag for a hacked account.
 

Check your device's installed apps and running processes for any unfamiliar or suspicious entries. Hackers may install malicious apps or run processes in the background to gain unauthorized access to your WhatsApp account.
 

WhatsApp Web and Desktop allow you to access your WhatsApp account on a computer. However, if you notice active sessions that you didn't initiate, it could indicate a hacked account. WhatsApp provides a feature to log out of all active sessions, which you can use to revoke unauthorized access.
 

If you receive unexpected account recovery verification codes or emails from WhatsApp, it could be a sign that someone is trying to gain unauthorized access to your account. Be cautious and take immediate action to secure your account.
 

Detecting a hacked WhatsApp account is crucial for safeguarding your privacy and security. By remaining vigilant and monitoring your account for signs of unauthorized access, you can take prompt action to secure your account. If you suspect a hack, follow the steps outlined in this guide to regain control of your WhatsApp account and reinforce its security. Remember to maintain good cybersecurity practices and keep your device and apps updated to minimize the risk of future security breaches.
