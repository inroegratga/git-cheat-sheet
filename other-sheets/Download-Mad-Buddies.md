Once paired, Buddies meet regularly to learn about each others' cultures, customs, and explore Manhattan & K-State.

Best Buddies is a global volunteer movement dedicated for forming one-to-one connections within communities of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Student peer buddies are matched with buddies who have IDD for one-on-one friendships. Best Buddies also hosts monthly group events that have included holiday parties, trivia, and karaoke.

Best Buddies is an international nonprofit organization that seeks to better the lives of individuals with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities. College chapters, like ours at BYU, are just some of the many programs available through Best Buddies.
 
In our chapter, we match buddy pairs of college students with adults from the community who have intellectual and developmental disabilities. Historically, adults with IDD have been isolated in-home or work environments. Best Buddies Colleges is changing this by providing opportunities for people with IDD to create meaningful one-to-one friendships and be involved in campus and community life!

**Volunteer Description:**Volunteers are paired with a buddy with special needs and meet with them frequently. Their responsibilities will be supporting and connecting with their buddy and participating in activities.
