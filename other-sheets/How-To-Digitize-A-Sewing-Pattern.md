The Big 4 pattern companies have started to reissue some vintage patterns. I read on one of their websites that they do not have the original patterns on file. They had to acquire vintage patterns and digitize them, just as Kathleen is proposing. I wonder if any of the original copyright holders would find digitized copies of their own patterns of value in trade for allowing Kathleen to sell or distribute them in some fashion.
 
I want to follow up on this conversation. Kathleen are you still offering to digitize vintage patterns? If so have you found any more information on the legal aspect of this? I have quite the vintage pattern collection and I am very interested in digitizing them for sale.
Thanks

This isn't a workflow i'm overly familiar with personally however I have found an in-depth tutorial linked below which covers converting traced sewing patterns to a Multipage document using A4 artboards and then exporting to PDF ready for printing, hopefully this will be of some assistance.
 
I would like to know how to photo or scan my paper sewing pattern to scale so I can digitized my pattern using AI. There are a load of youtube video on tracing the pattern and altering using AI but the first step is missing.. How can I get the best photo result or scan result so I make the right size.
 
Do I take pictures horizontally on the floor or vertically on the wall, where should I take the close on and angle or bird eye view to get the best results for tracing lines. Special setting for the camera?
 
1) Either scan at highest possible resolution and size if possible, or take a high resolution photo straight on (as Ton has said already) in clear daylight or with a light source that gives an even background.
 
Many of whom are also my patrons on Patreon, as well. 2nd and 3rd tier patrons will be receiving free digital patterns periodically, with 3rd tier patrons receiving a deep discount for printed versions. Neat huh!?
 
Not only am I able to digitize the patterns, but I can also grade the single-sized patterns found in the GLB magazines. My goal is to not only preserve these patterns that would otherwise be lost to time, due to the discontinuation of the magazine itself, but also to make these patterns more available and accessible to all body types.

Sewing patterns are a great way to make your own clothes and make a little extra money on the side. The first step is to understand what a sewing pattern is and what it does, then you can decide what kind of pattern you want to make. From there you will learn how to make basic blocks that allow you to create other patterns from them. Using software for computer-generated patterns is a great way to make sewing patterns for sale, but there is still some work to do by hand afterwards. Finally, this article will deal with how to digitize and edit patterns digitally, as well as how to test them.
 
If you want to create a sewing pattern from scratch, you must use a pattern drafting software or draft the pattern by hand. There are many pattern drafting methods for creating sewing patterns. There are specialized pattern making software programs, some of them are available online to create your patterns. You can also draft them by hand or use the draping technique creating the pattern pieces by placing fabric over a mannequin and tracing its contours on paper before cutting and sewing the pieces individually together in order to form a pattern.
 
As soon as you have your pattern, you need to digitize it so you will need software that allows you to edit your pattern and prepare the PDF document. It is important that the pattern is accurate, even if it means that you are going through the process several times.
 
Pattern transformations are the way you create any style by altering the basic block. The most important pattern transformations are: bust dart manipulations, adding fullness, adding style lines and draping. Bust darts are used to add shape. The fullness can be added to the pattern to make the garment look more voluminous. Style lines, such as pleats, ruffles, or pockets, can be added to any pattern. The patterns can also be manipulated by adjusting the ease, length, or silhouette. By manipulating these pattern pieces, you can create any style of clothing.
 
Fitting is the process of checking a pattern to ensure that it fits perfectly and to detect where and how modifications are needed. You have to make a muslin sewing the garment with cheap fabric. There are many ways you can make your pattern fit perfectly. This process is very important as a badly fitting garment not only looks bad, but also feels uncomfortable. To make sure the pattern fits perfectly, you can make the necessary changes by either increasing or decreasing a part of the pattern, depending on your needs. In order to achieve the best results, you will have to repeat this step as many times as necessary until you are satisfied.
 
Pattern grading is the process of taking a pattern and resizing to fit a different size range. Pattern grading can be as simple as sizing a sewing pattern, but in most cases, this involves adjusting the way the pattern pieces are cut so that they fit well to most body shapes. There are many different types of grades that you can do, but for beginners, I recommend trying standard grading. This makes all your pattern pieces larger or smaller by about 4 cm widthways. You can grade your pattern by hand or digitally once you have digitized and edited your pattern pieces.
 
Turning your sewing patterns into full-sized digital PDF versions is becoming a trend to the DIY industry. Many readers find that these printable PDF patterns are better than buying in the stores as it saves them time and money. Independent designers have also started sharing their patterns, reaching out to those who prefer doing the craft than getting the end product. It has also been one way to monetize the pattern online with the digital version on hand.
 
**Step one:**Start with your pattern. Create your own pattern manually, on your paper. Once this is already done, you can start scanning your pattern piece per piece. Most likely, your pattern will be bigger than your scanner, so cutting it into smaller pieces will be necessary. Use an a4 size paper or an 81/2 x 11 size paper as your basis for cutting (same size as your scanner). Make sure they are in JPG or JPEG file as you will use these in Photoshop/illustrator.
 
**Step two:** Open your software, create a new canvas large enough to fit your pattern and choose an image size of 150DPI. (DPI = 150 pixels per inch). This will be the resolution of your pattern is the actual size.
 
Once this is set, insert your images to assemble your scanned patterns, making one whole pattern. You can do this by opening the image, then dragging it to your new canvas. Do this to all of the scanned images.
 
**Note:** Other methods may allow you to use a high-resolution camera to take a photo of your whole pattern. Just make sure to put a measuring device beside it so actual measurements will be used as your basis.
 
Trace your hand-drawn pattern with a Pen Tool to make digital clean lines. You can trace your drawn lines by clicking from point to point. The tool will stop creating lines once your back to the starting point. You can also adjust the points to make a curve on your lines.
 
**Step five:** Repeat the steps above for all other patterns, if any. Add text to your pattern for labels or information that needs to be shown. E.x. Add measurements or branding in the middle of the pattern.
 
**Step eight:** Save your pattern as PDF. Make sure to change the file format when you "save as" or you could also use our JPG to PDF converter if you've already saved it as a JPG file. This also supports BMP, TIFF and PNG files for conversion.
 
UPDATE: I have course called Creating PDF Patterns + Pattern Grading available now to teach you how to scan, digitize, format for printing, and draft within Illustrator and grade to create your own PDF patterns. The course is taught through a combination of written course materials and video, and each lesson includes printable resources.
 
This is really interesting to me Melissa! PR&P definitely changed the way I feel about following patterns and freed me up to change everything I wanted to change. But those books look great for going to the next step. Thanks for sharing all your resources!
 
I started reading your blog back during when you were in American Crafter and I am really enjoying what you have to offer. I love sundresses and I also have a 3 y.o. boy to sew for, so your series this summer are right up my alley. Just wanted to say thanks for all your hard wrok!
