That's considered normal ,just to get to the front strut you have to take off the bulkhead covers and the complete wiper assembly ,these cars are made for dealer only servicing with inflated prices ,one person was quoted 650 to change the cambelt and water pump ,had I have known this before I would never have bought one !

It's easy change oil filter: pull passenger side front grill out, drill 25-30mm hole in plastic cover behind that grill or mask. Put tree legged oil filter tool in it's place at filter. Then use several long 3/8 socket rods and push them tru that hole. Now it is very easy to remove or turn filter tight with t spanner outside of car front. After that put piece of tape to cover hole, you can use again in next oil filter change. This is fast and easy way to do it.
 
I struggled to remove the oil filter but eventually succeeded by making a noose out of some extension flex slip it over the filter from underneath the front of the car again it isnt easy making sure the noose tightens with the more force applied if you have ever used lifting strops you will know what I mean the filter didnt budge until I got the engine oil filter warm by running the engine,you have to be bloody minded.
