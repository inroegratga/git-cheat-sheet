The story focuses on Semba a.k.a. Sembaruthi, a maid working for the Rajasekar family. Both Rajasekar and his wife Lakshmi treat Semba as their own daughter, but their daughters-in-law Archana and Vadivu and Rajasekar's elder daughter worry that Semba will inherit part of the family property, reducing their own shares, so they mistreat Semba. Karthik is Rajasekar's youngest son and returns to Chennai after a period spent working as a scientist in Singapore. Karthik combats the difficulties Semba faces.
 
Karthik's girlfriend Divya comes from Singapore to visit his family. Vadivu's brother Sanjay attempts to seduce Semba but is stopped by Karthik, who decides that Semba should marry and uploads her profile to a marriage website. A groom comes to visit, but Sanjay intercepts him and tells him lies about Semba, so he leaves without meeting her. Archana brings in a groom who is a distant relative and an alcoholic. The groom's family proposes marriage within two days, and Rajasekar's family accepts the proposal. Preparations for the wedding are in full swing when it is discovered that the groom is still married to his first wife, whom he abandoned.

Meanwhile, Karthik and Divya are planning to get engaged on Semba's wedding day. Divya goes to the airport to fetch her parents, who are arriving from Singapore. Semba's marriage is stopped and Rajasekar is blamed by everyone for her pitiable position. Rajasekar is devastated and persuades Karthik to marry Semba to mitigate the disaster of the failed wedding. Divya arrives at the last moment, just in time to see the wedding become official. Divya asks Karthik whether he married Semba only out of pity, but he remains silent and leaves angrily.
 
After Divya leaves, Karthik expresses his anger by throwing things. His mother realises that her son has been sacrificed, and she becomes furious and turns against her husband, and eventually Semba. Semba does not expect Karthik to treat her like a real wife, so she continues to work as a maid. One day Lakshmi's friend comes to meet Semba, not knowing her history, and she criticises the family for marrying a maid to their son. Humiliated, Lakshmi is persuaded by Archana and Vadivu to call Divya back. Meanwhile, Rajasekar plans a reception for the newlyweds, but is only supported by his brother Chandrasekar, youngest daughter Vinodhini, and her fianc Harish.
 
Divya comes to the reception and causes drama when Karthik accepts Semba as his wife. Then the couple prepares to spend their first night together, but Lakshmi suddenly begins to have chest pains. Karthik panics and stays with his mother. Since she is not allowed to see Lakshmi, Semba sleeps alone in the room that she was to share with Karthik. This event is a turning point, as Lakshmi and Karthik begin to appreciate her. Archana, Vadivu and Sanjay all try to undermine Semba and make her leave the house, but Karthik begins to fall in love with her.
 
Karthik entrusts Semba with documents about his confidential project involving space and the military. Archana, Vadivu and Sanjay steal the documents and blame Semba. Karthik is angry and humiliates Semba, who finds the documents and reveals that Sanjay was the thief, but is so humiliated that she leaves the house. Karthik later finds her and brings her home.
 
Karthik and Semba's relationship becomes stronger, and he confesses his love to her and she accepts. Meanwhile, Divya offers Karthik a job without revealing her identity. He and Semba go to a party to celebrate his new job, and find Divya there. She was previously married to Vicky, a rich 65-year-old businessman, and is wealthy.
