***Gṛhastha*** (Sanskrit: गृहस्थ) literally means "being in and occupied with home, family" or "householder".[1] It refers to the second phase of an individual's life in a four age-based stages of the Hindu asrama system.[2] It follows celibacy (bachelor student) life stage, and embodies a married life, with the duties of maintaining a home, raising a family, educating one's children, and leading a family-centred and a dharmic social life.[3][4][5]
 
This stage of *Asrama* is conceptually followed by *Vānaprastha* (forest dweller, retired[6]) and *Sannyasa* (renunciation).[3] Combined with other three life stages, Hindu philosophy considers these stages as a facet of Dharma concept, something essential to completing the full development of a human being and fulfilling all the needs of the individual and society.[3][7]

Ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism consider *Gṛhastha* stage as the most important of all stages in sociological context, as human beings in this stage not only pursue a virtuous life, they produce food and wealth that sustains people in other stages of life, as well as the offspring that continues mankind.[3][8] The householder stage is also considered in Indian philosophy as one where the most intense physical, procreational, emotional, occupational, social and material attachments exist in a human being's life.[9]
 
In Indian traditions, *Gṛhastha* stage of life is a recommendation, but not a requirement. Any *Brahmachari* may, if they want, skip householder and retirement stage, go straight to Sannyasa stage of life, thereby renouncing worldly and materialistic pursuits and dedicating their lives to spiritual pursuits.[7]
 
Gṛhastha is part of the ancient Hindu concept called Chaturashrama, which identified four stages of a human life, with distinct differences based on natural human needs and drives, as well as how these *stages* integrated with fulfilling, joyful four *goals* of life called Purushartha - Dharma (piety, morality, duties), Artha (wealth, health, means of life), Kama (love, relationships, emotions) and Moksha (liberation, freedom, self-realization).[7] Gṛhastha is considered to be the most intense of all four stages, where a man or woman pursues all four goals of life, with greater emphasis on first three - Dharma, Artha and Kama.[4][5][12] In contrast, Sannyasa is the stage where the individual renounces Artha and Kama, and pursues Moksha with a single minded pursuit.[4][7]
 
The stage "Gṛhastha" is preceded by Brahmacharya (student) stage of life, and followed by Vanaprastha (retirement, forest dweller, still an advisor to the next generation) stage. In ancient texts, Gṛhastha stage of life is said to extend from the age of about 25 to about 50.[7]
 
A man or woman entered the *Gṛhastha* stage after a Hindu wedding [sacred ceremony]. They would build a home, raise a family, earn wealth, enjoy worldly life and give donations to needy people, poor families, orphans, etc... They also have to follow the 5 great rituals ( Pancha Maha Yajnas) as follow:

The Chandogya Upanishad and Vedānta Sūtras discuss all four stages of life - student, householder, retired/hermit and ascetic. However they hold Gṛhastha āśrama as the highest because, explains verse III.4.48, not only does the householder performs the duties recommended for all four asramas, they have to produce food and goods on which people in other ashramas survive. The shared duties of four ashramas are - tenderness for all living creatures (ahimsa), self-restraints, and others.[14]
 
Grihastha ashrama, declares Gautama Dharmasutra in verses 3.2 and 3.3, is the foundation of all the ashramas, and essential to the existence and continuation of society because the other three ashramas do not produce offspring.[3][17]
 
In Sections IV.1 through IV.6, Manusmriti states a Brahmana, after being twice-born and completing his studies with his teacher, should marry and live in his house.[20] He must seek a means of living that causes no injury or least possible injury to all living beings, except in times of distress. For this householder stage, the text declares that the Brahmana (graduate from Brahmacharya) should accumulate property by ethically pursuing his varna's (class) occupation.[20] Manusmriti lists[20] five appropriate sources of income or means for survival for the educated Brahmana - Ṛta (ऋत, lawful gleaning and gathering, proper natural work[21]), Amrta (अमृत, accepting gifts and charity), Mrta (मृत, begging), Pramrta (प्रमृत,[22] agriculture, tillage) and Satyanrta (सत्यानृत,[23] trade, commerce, money lending). The text disapproves of one means of survival for the householder - Shvavritti (श्ववृत्ति,[24] dog-like subsistence, servitude, slavery[25]).
 
When the scriptural studies appropriate to the student have been completed, and he has received blessings of his Guru, let him enter into the order of the **Gṛhastha** (householder). Let him pursue and obtain, by ethical ways, home, wife, and wealth, discharge to the best of his ability the duties of his life's stage. He should satisfy the soul of his ancestors with funeral cakes; the gods with oblations; guests with hospitality; the sages with holy study; the progenitors of mankind with progeny; the spirits with reverence; and all the world with words of truth.
 
The Indian Epics have extensive debates on Gṛhastha stage of life, offering a contrasting spectrum of views on its merits and nature.[27] An illustrative recommended guidelines for conduct in householder stage of life is stated in Book 1, the Adi Parva of the Mahabharata, as follows,[28][29]
 
It hath been said in the oldest Upanishad that a **Grihastha** (householder), acquiring wealth by honest means, should perform sacrifices; he should always give something in charity, should perform the rites of hospitality unto all arriving at his abode, and should never use anything without giving a portion thereof to others. He should abstain from all vicious acts, should never inflict pain on any creature. It is then only that he can achieve success.
 
We had to change our consciousness, Prabhupada told us, and put Krsna at the center. That, he said, would make all the difference. When our false ego is at the center, we have so many problems, but when Krsna is at the center, our relationships become harmonious.
 
These material bodies are just dresses for the soul. Our identities based on the body and mind are temporary and illusory. Our real identities are as loving servants of Krsna and His devotees, and whatever we are doing here in the material world is practice for our eternal life in the spiritual world, where we will serve Krsna and His devotees in ecstatic love. As Srila Prabhupada said, if a high school student is doing college-level work, he can be promoted to college. So if we are in the material world but are engaged in the activities of the spiritual world, we can be promoted to the spiritual world. The basic activity of the spiritual world, which includes chanting the holy names and glories of Sri Krsna, is to render loving service to Krsna and the other servants of Krsna. And the grhastha asrama is a suitable situation for practicing loving service, which can qualify us for eternal loving service in the spiritual world.
 
A Grhastha lives a God centered life. He knows the ultimate goal of life but is not able to be completely renounced. A Grhastha is aware that the sense gratification permitted to him will eventually lead to misery and therefore he sincerely endeavors to overcome his tendency for sense gratification by practicing Krishna Consciousness.
 
If a husband and wife combine together in Krishna consciousness and live together peacefully, help each other and serve each other that is very nice. However, if one is attracted to the opposite sex simply for sex enjoyment, then it becomes an impediment to spiritual progress and the implications of materialistic life will again resume.
 
The Supreme Lord Krishna compassionately describes how a householder should act until his natural propensity for sense gratification, for enjoying sense objects is overcome and he fully attains the characteristics of a pure devotee.
 
Srila Prabhupada has said that it does not matter whether one is a brahmacari, a Grhastha or a sannyasi. He must try to be a confidential servant of Lord Krishna. The institution of marriage in the Vedic perspective is not to be condemned. Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva and Yamaraja, who are described as mahajanas are Grhasthas.
 
Lord Gauranga was an ideal Grhastha and later an ideal sannyasi. Many of the associates of Lord Gauranga also had a married life. Arjuna was a Grhastha, a king and a politician. The Supreme Lord Krishna selected Arjuna for imparting the highest
 
It is described that service in the Grhastha asrama is like crossing over a hill because there are so many obstacles. The duties and responsibilities can be painful at times. However, the service should be rendered in a spirit of detachment, sense of duty with proper understanding for a harmonious living in Krishna Consciousness.
 
Vedic culture is a culture of sharing and giving with the consciousness that everything in the universe is controlled and owned by the Lord and that one should accept only those things that necessary for himself, which are set aside as his quota.
