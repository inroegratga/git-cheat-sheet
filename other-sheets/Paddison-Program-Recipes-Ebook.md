In addition to this, it is very important that the diet is extremely nutrient-dense and full of the fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals that contribute to health and vitality. We may all have a common starting point in the Autoimmune Protocol, but where we land as far as what our bodies can tolerate may be very different, and can also change with time. My goal here is not to confuse you, but to inspire you to go about this process in a way that will produce lasting lifestyle changes that are in tune with your unique body in order to bring you healing.

This book contains over 110 elimination diet friendly recipes, including appetizers, snacks, soups, stews, salads, main dishes, and desserts. Also included are 2 4-week meal plans, shopping lists, and all the information you need to get started on your healing journey.
 
I highly recommend listening to The Paleo View podcast with The Paleo Mom and Stacy Toth of Paleo Parents. There are AIP specific podcasts, but also good introductions to paleo eating in general. An easy way to get some of that information that is hard to digest when you are just clicking around on the internet. Good luck!

 
Hi Karolina,
 I do believe that leaky gut and autoimmune disease go hand in hand. You may find this article from Chris Kresser helpful, he talks about why it is important for thyroid patients to avoid gluten:

I agree! Its easy on this plan to steer clear of all those terrible non-food creations, but it becomes a pickle once you start healing and are confronted with those items once again. I still never eat out while at home, but vacations have been tricky!
 
Hey Denise,
 Sounds like you are really sensitive to nightshades, which is common in people with RA. They are also particularly tricky to avoid. I am unfortunately very sensitive to them and also get really bad joint pain when I consume them. I hope the autoimmune protocol helps you figure out what else could be triggering your flares!
 
Ellie,
 I am not too familiar with them, other than I know that some people are sensitive to them. I would do an AIP that is based on meats, broth and fats for a few days and then introduce the AIP-friendly fruits and vegetables, one at a time starting with the ones least likely to be problematic. Then you will know for sure what you tolerate and can include in your personal version of AIP. Good luck!
 
Hi Lucy,
 You never know how long it will take until you try to reintroduce foods. A lot of us with more serious issues stay on the protocol, or a modified version fairly long-term (I have been eating this way, with the addition of nuts, seeds, and occasional eggs for a year and half). Good luck!
 
What a great article. My husband was diagnosed with Sero Negative Spondarthritis 2 years ago and was off work for 6 months but has never really been right since. He would have probably about 2-3 weeks being symptom free and then get symptoms for about 3-4 weeks. It seems to me that the doctors only give you pills etc to make things easier but dont really research into the cause. So we have decided to take health into our own hands and have been researching Paleo for a while now and have read lots of good things about it. Would be interested if anyone else has had this condition and if they went Paleo / AIP and any advice about where to start. We are on a very tight budget and would love to start but not sure how. Thanks
 
Hello Mickey!
 I recently discovered your site, so i am really thrilled about all the stuff i am reading(which is really a lot to cope with).
 Well i havent been diagnosed with any aid but i am soooo worried i could suffer from one.I have mild joint paints now and then, everyone says that it is the bad posture from holding thebaby and the continuous breastfeeding(i gavebirth a few months ago), but i am terrified it could be something else like RA or lupus.My blood tests are all fine, except crp which is positive.I thought i have celiac but i have been tested and the tests came back negative-thought a little bit higher than expected.I am in a gaps diet plus excluded sugar and starches a month now.At first i was feeling superb.It hasbeen 10days now that i wake up feeling tired, thebrain fog continues to exist and the energy levels are particularly low.Again, eveyone is thinking that it is due to the breastfeeding and the waking up several times in the night.What am i doing wrong?i have no idea.I think i cant tolerate so much meat.So my question to you, is this: do you think that i should ditch the gaps diet and follow a strictlier protocol? In theory,could the ai protocol prevent an aid from appearing? COuld you please, please give me some advice,something to start with, i could really use?perhaps i should test the antibodies for those autoimmune diseases..i am really new to all the healthy stuff, there have passed several years by with eating every cr@p that you can name, so i am worried something would happen to me..Thank you for your excellent work, and your time,
 
As far as GAPS vs AIP I am not quite sure which would be better for you. To be honest, if I were you I would take a step back and just eat Paleo, excepting any foods you have clear reactions. You may be restricting yourself too much, causing yourself more stress and making your condition worse. Just a hunch!
 
I was wondering if you knew anything about going paleo and auto immune skin conditions , I was diagonsed with thyroid disease 5 years ago and then vitilgo 2 years ago. I went to a dermatologist and took cream and steroid shots with no help. I then started going to get acupuncture and taking chinese herbs. I have been doing that for 6 months now with also elimanating gluten for 6 months so far.. I have noticed a slow down in losing pigment but i still find new spots here and there. Going paleo is my last resort ..
 
Cindy,
 I would consider trying the Autoimmune Protocol with any autoimmune disease, and have heard lots of good reports from those with skin conditions. Regular Paleo may not be enough, as many people have triggers such as eggs or nightshades which are included on the Paleo diet. Best of luck to you!
 
Paige,
 Often figuring out our health is like a giant puzzle, with teeny tiny pieces that take years to figure out where to place! I also have MTHFR, and it is something worth finding a practitioner to help you with. Anything you can be doing to move yourself to a diet full of nutrient-dense, whole foods, and away from processed grains and sugar will help you. Wishing you the best of luck on your journey!
 
For weight gain, I would suggest making sure you get enough starchy carbs, and use them as vehicles for fat. Make sure whenever you eat veggies, they are covered in high-quality fat (coconut oil, lard, tallow, evoo etc). I would also eat a moderate amount of fruit (1-3 pieces a day).
 
I have a condition called CIDP that apparently became active after a food poisoning I got in the Himalayas last year. The condition makes it hard for me to walk properly, and so has it been for the last seven months. I`m looking into different diets. Would this be something to try for me with my diagnosis? Are there any research on this in relation to CIDP?
 
Kim, If you can find hormone-free at the very least that is doable. Have you checked eatwild.org for a farm near you? I find buying meat in bulk and freezing is the best way to keep the high quality stuff at a price I can afford it. Good luck!
 
Larissa,
 You should not be feeling worse, although some people do have lower energy and some GI changes as they make the transition. Are you being sure to include enough starchy carbs in your diet? Its hard to troubleshoot without knowing exactly what you are eating. I would suggest finding one of the online support groups (There is a great one called The Paleo Approach Community on FB) and seeing if some of the members there can help give you some ideas.
 
Hi, I have thyroiditis and celiac. I started following the elimination diet. I am having meat everyday and I started to feel slight uneasiness in my small intestine area which might be result of inflammation.
 
Hi Venkat,
 I think this question is best addressed by a medical practitioner, if you are experiencing pain it is time to see a doctor. Some people have digestive difficulties and find that supplements like HCL or enzymes help them with digestion, but these need to be recommended by a practitioner. Good luck!
 
Hi Mickey, thanks for your response. I am open to eating Fish/Seafood and Egg but unfortunately not meat. Would it still be feasible to follow the diet and do you have any recipes specific to a Pescatarian diet?
 Many thanks
 Natasha
 
Lastly I want to know if you can recommend good meat options. There is very little information online about what is a viable meat source for auto immune paleo. Lots of sources say saturated meat fats are pro inflammatory. Secondly they say grain fed animals produce pro inflammatory chemicals when we break down their meat. So does that mean we should stay away from pork? what about lamb? all i know is that cows are grain fed. So assuming grain fed cows and pasteurized organic non antibiotic poultry is also on the menu, what else is acceptable? Should I be avoiding fatty grass fed beef cuts too?
