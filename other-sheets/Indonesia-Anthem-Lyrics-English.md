The Second Indonesian Youth Congress (the first one had been held two years previously but did not lead to any results), organized on 28 October 1928, thus came with the following youth pledge (sumpah pemuda), emphasizing the unity of Indonesia:

It was during this Second Indonesian Youth Congress that Wage Rudolf Supratman performed the song Indonesia Raya for the first time (on violin). Supratman (1903-1938) was a journalist, musician and teacher who had written this song in the context of the Youth Congress.


 
However, as this Youth Congress was basically a subversive movement in the late colonial days of Indonesia and the lyrics of the song Indonesia Raya were considered too nationalistic (although the original version did not contain the lyrics "merdeka" or "Independence"), it was quickly banned by the Dutch colonizers. As the nationalist movement developed further, the colonial authorities reacted with an act of suppression.
 
The Dutch colonizers were powerful enough to hold back Indonesian nationalism by arresting its nationalist leaders and suppressing nationalist organizations. However, the Dutch would never be able to eliminate widespread nationalist sentiment. The Indonesians, on the other hand, did not have the power to compete with the colonial rulers and therefore were dependent on external forces to eliminate the colonial system.
 
In March 1942 the Japanese, fuelled by their desire for oil, provided help by occupying the Dutch Indies. Although the Japanese period (1942-1945) would become a period characterized by hardship (scarcity of food, clothing and medicines as well as forced labour under harsh conditions), the Japanese also educated, trained and armed young Indonesians and gave their nationalist leaders a political voice. This enabled the nationalists to prepare for a future independent Indonesian nation. In the final months before Japan's surrender, effectively ending World War II, the Japanese gave full support to the Indonesian nationalist movement. On 17 August 1945, two days after the Nagasaki atomic bombing, Soekarno and Hatta proclaimed the independence of Indonesia. At this occasion the song Indonesia Raya became the national anthem of the Republic of Indonesia.

A generally patriotic musical composition - usually in the form of a song or hymn of praise - that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions, or struggles of a nation or its people. National anthems can be officially recognized as a national song by a country's constitution or by an enacted law, or simply by tradition. Although most anthems contain lyrics, some do not.

"We dare to dream, we care to share. Together for ASEAN. We dare to dream, we care to share. For it's the way of ASEAN." Still unfamiliar with the lyrics of the song? The lyrics are the official hymn or song of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), entitled "The ASEAN Way".
 
"The ASEAN Way" is composed by a musician from Thailand, Payom Valaiphatchra, and arranged by Kittikhun Sodpraset. The ASEAN anthem was not chosen randomly; "The ASEAN Way" was selected through a long process. The ASEAN song selection occurred from October 2007 to November 2008 in Thailand.
 
The selection of the ASEAN hymn was attended by the best musicians from 10 ASEAN member countries, with a total of 99 songs listed in the ASEAN Anthem Copyright Selection. Then, it was curated back into the 10 best songs, which were assessed directly by the jury.
 
The judging process was also considered very special because the jury consisted of 13 musicians and composers, representatives from ten ASEAN member countries, and representatives from China, Japan, and Australia appointed directly by the ASEAN Secretariat General.
 
"The ASEAN Way" was chosen since it represented the spirit of the ASEAN Charter. The ASEAN Charter reaffirms the principles contained in all agreements, declarations, and agreements that promote countries in the region.
 
Another reason for choosing "The ASEAN Way" as the ASEAN hymn is because it fulfills the criteria of an anthem, which can be sung solemnly full of pride, and the lyric is not long, so it is easy to remember. It represents the ASEAN slogan, "One Vision, One Identity, One Community".
 
With the long selection process, on 20 November 2008, "The ASEAN Way" was officially chosen as the ASEAN hymn. "The ASEAN Way" was first sung in an official event in the hall of the ASEAN Secretariat building in Jakarta on 15 December 2008.
 
JAKARTA - There are many stories about the song Indonesia Raya. Since the Second Youth Congress, the song composed by Wage Rudolf (WR) Soepratman became a form of resistance against the Dutch. Very exalted. But not for the Netherlands. Indonesia Raya is not dangerous, he said. The Dutch even repeatedly humiliated Indonesia Raya by calling it unfit to be the national anthem.
 
The spirit of movement in WR Soepratman's blood is unquestionable. It is the complete package of freedom fighters. Soepratman was a journalist who ignited the anti-colonial spirit of the Alpena news agency and the Chinese-Malay ne
