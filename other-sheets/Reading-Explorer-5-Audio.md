Then I put some MP3 or WAV files in. Windows Explorer "kindly" changes the column types. It will show Genre, media length, Album and other metadata tags, but does not show the file size anymore. If I do not like it, I have to manually change the columns back. It is very irritating.
 
You have to disable the "Automatic Folder Type Discovery" feature present in Windows Vista and later versions. (This solution is tested on Windows Vista, and probably works on Windows 7 as well. I'm not sure about Windows 8 / 8.1 / 10).

After the adding the Size column, or making whatever changes you like, save those settings as the default for that kind of folder. You can drag Size towards the left, so that it is easily visible. Then you can either ignore the additional columns or delete them. Then save the resulting layout as default:
 
First check that you aren't accidentally changing the default for "General Items". Right-click the folder, choose Properties -> Customize. Make sure "Optimize this folder for" is set to Music or Video, as appropriate.
 
I am using Windows 10 64bit OS. I opened the file explorer and navigated to C drive in the main window (not the tree). I selected "Documents" and went to Properties --> Customize. I enabled "Also apply to all subfolders" and selected the format "Documents" and hit "Apply." Then I changed it to "General Items" and hit "Apply" again. Then I closed out, went to my folder (full of wave files) and the columns remained as General Items with file name, type, size, date etc.
 
When any of the parent folders containing audio files where named "**music**"[\*], Windows would automatically infer that the folder view in Windows Explorer needed to be optimized for "music" and thus would read and display metadata (a process that is slow even on a fast drive). This happened although I had customized all folders for "General items" (in folder Properties -> Customize tab). Then I changed this folder's name to "mp3wav" and again customized it and its sub-folders for "General items". That avoided the reading of metadata and thus access is lightning fast.
 
I have the tool bar menu activated which contains the menu items "File Edit View Tools Help" which only become active when I first click on a folder in the left pane and then click on white space in the right pane, meaning do not click on a file or sub folder in right pane that are listed as being in the parent folder.

I'm not sure if this is what you are looking for but I have been searching for everything to make my experience of editing easier.I stumbled here for one of my answers. What you described sounded a little difficult.I just went back to my folder and at the top heading of the columns right clicked got a menu choice of "size column" or "size all columns" to fit, opened and closed and it stayed.Also if yo click in the right place menu also gives choices of columns.This seemed easy to find as i have trouble searching files explorer reports not found even when it is right there.I don't know what I did to see explorer window without permissions im not sure but I got the Idea I ended up changing permissions on the C drive it's working ok.I know it's not right i dont know what trusted installer should be allowed.I own the c drive I'm not sure that is right either.Anyway do you use Foobar I added the burn file. Also figured uot how to build a cue sheet with EAC from a file and then burn. So I'll be lucky if I ever get this video edited. Good luck I get so tred of resizing columns and i need to wathc those items to keep track of the sceene,and from various folders.I do this I go looking for answers and answer myself.Thanks [email protected]
 
Audio files, along with Praat TextGrid files, are available here for many of the figures presented in the book. For these figures, you can load the audio and its associated Praat TextGrid into the Praat software (see Links page) to explore the files we used to create the screenshots presented in the book. We also provide a set of sample reading passages from the Vowels in America project.
 
**Figures 8.2-8.4 Praat editor windows showing a sound file with orthographic transcription (manually produced, manually aligned at the utterance level) and with phonemic transcription after processing by forced alignment**
 
The following audio files contain reading passage recordings by 8 speakers from the Vowels in America project. The speakers are from the three US dialect regions focused on in that work. All speakers are white (U.S. state affiliation, gender, and age group are indicated for each speaker). Along with audio files, you can download two versions of Praat TextGrids containing transcriptions of the speech. The first version is an orthographic transcript, aligned at the utterance-level. The second version is the output from the Montreal Forced Aligner, with word and phones aligned to the audio. These files can be used for practice with the vowel and sibilant analysis scripts provided on the Scripts & Code page.
 
Many of the databases available for Macdonald-Kelce Library users follow the standards of 29 U.S.C. 794d (more commonly known as Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act) and/or use Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) as part of the accessibility verification process.
 
Before entering the database it is necessary to accept the terms and conditions. JAWS (screen reading software) does read these automatically. Once heard you can press tab to highlight "I accept the above terms" then enter. The default is to search The ACM Digital Library rather than The Guide, which is correct, but the search box on the homepage is labelled as The Guide Edit. If your links list your search results, the article title appears first, followed by the full text in PDF and sometimes HTML format.
 
View the HTML version if available as the PDF files are often without headings and therefore hard to navigate. Before you can download any full text item you will need to disable your pop up blocker as full text opens in a new window. Use Adobe Reader to convert the PDF, although it still may not read in a linear way. Articles can also be converted to a more accessible format using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) equipment.
 
Select the HTML Full Text link.
 Click on the orange play icon (appearing just under the article's
 title) to start the audio.
 You can select up to three accents from the drop down menu box.
 Click the download icon to download an mp3 file of the audio.

From JSTOR: We have made every effort to ensure that our image-based PDF files are accessible and can be read with screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver. These files are tagged at a high level using an automated process. While this method is not exact, it significantly increases the accessibility of files as compared to an untagged version. We are happy to provide files in either PDF or Word (.docx) format upon request.
 
This database is **complex** and uses **frames**. For keyboard users it is recommended that you use F6 and SHIFT+F6 to move between the frames. There are a few drop down boxes that refresh the screen as soon as you use the arrow key to move to the next option when using Internet Explorer. To open the drop down box and then select the option you want ,press ALT+ DOWN ARROW, select your preferred option using UP and DOWN ARROW and then press ENTER to activate it. The search results pages have five frames. Listed below are the headings of each frame with a brief explanation of what they cover:
 
To search from initial page list the links and select Search. Search results are displayed in the order of check box, result number, reference details and then View HTML and View PDF to read the full text. Select **View HTML**, which includes heading levels to aid navigation.
 
Internet Explorer users who want to specify date ranges in Advanced Search must use ALT + DOWN ARROW to open the Date Range combo box and use the up and down arrows to move through the options. Press enter to choose the appropriate date range, which may then open another box for you to enter the date details. If you don't access the combo box this way JAWS is confused when the additional date range boxes are automatically generated as you move through the options and stops reading. Choose Full Text, rather than Full Text - PDF, where available. Once you are in Full Text, select level heading 2, to move straight to the full text. This is not a known issue with FireFox.
 
The National Library of Medicine (NLM) converts and stores submitted articles to the ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2015 JATS eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format, which enables long-term preservation and supports accessibility. NLM displays articles in PMC in structured HTML that is responsive to different screen sizes and devices and compatible with assistive technologies to enable broad accessibility. Pubmed has recently been amended so that article titles now appear as links to further information, rather than the authors, so the database is easier to navigate.
