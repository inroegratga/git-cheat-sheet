If I were to write a haunted house novel, I know where I would start: the setting. The canon practically demands a stately manor from the pages of a historical register or an architectural study, all turrets and gables and perhaps a few strange windows that seem a little too much like eyes. Long hallways, flickering light from an early electric bulb or a candle, rooms with furniture shrouded in sheets . . . and nooks, so many nooks, to hide in.

After it was retired as an ocean liner, Disney purchased The Queen Mary, and B340 became a prototype Haunted Mansion-at-sea. The room was wired for spooky happenings, like creaking floorboards and faucets turning on by themselves, and eventually closed when the experiment was unprofitable. But smoke and mirrors aside, the room's history is rife with suspicious or unexplained deaths, and there are rumors of many other sinister disasters on the ship: a girl drowning in one of the (now closed) pools; a man being crushed to death in the boiler rooms; a criminal held by authorities dying alone under eerie, grotesque circumstances. (I'll spare you the details, but think "entrails.")

At least one tragedy is confirmed: During The Queen Mary's stint transporting soldiers in WWII, there was a catastrophic collision with the HMS Curacoa, tearing the smaller boat in half. Over 300 people drowned.
 
The ship leans into its haunted history, offering ghost tours and recreating Victorian seances aboard, which means it draws in a lot of para-curious people. During my stay, I was traveling with Strange Escapes, a supernatural tourism company run by Amy Bruni, a paranormal investigator who got her start on Ghost Hunters and now stars on Kindred Spirits. Bruni had gathered a group of 200 to explore the haunted ship, with the assistance of other famous paranormal investigators, including two other Ghost Hunters: Grant Wilson and Adam Berry, who's now Bruni's co-star on Kindred Spirits.
 
In B340, in the bedroom and the small, attached sitting room, I found a group of novice investigators huddled in the dark with Greg and Dana Newkirk and John E.L. Tenney, paranormal experts leading the investigation. The Newkirks had brought along some truly grisly items from their Traveling Museum of the Paranormal & Occult, including a spirit board made from floor planks salvaged from the site of an axe murder.
 
During the investigations that night, the experts used three different methods to channel the spirits: Greg Newkirk and John Tenney held EVP (electronic voice phenomena) sessions, using recorders to ask questions in an effort to capture responses the human ear can't perceive. Dana Newkirk pulled tarot on two different decks. Both Newkirks used the Estes Method, in which one person asks questions and the other, while in a sort-of sensory deprivation environment, repeats what he or she hears through the spirit box.
 
I heard many responses that night, while I sat in the dark through two different investigation sessions, and none of them were good. There were many frustrated spirits in that room, and a huge amount of confused, angry energy. At one point, after Greg pressed the issue of why a spirit wasn't telling us its name, it hissed "HASSLE" before going silent for the night.
 
The ship makes no attempt to hide B340's history. Now that's it's reopened to the public, the room rents out at a premium, and there are accounts of ghost sightings inscribed on the walls. People come looking for the unmarked room every night. (Visitors persistently pilfer the room number as a souvenir). But I didn't know any of that at the time. So when I heard whispers outside my door, I nearly jumped out of my skin. And when I got up to answer the door, I didn't even have time to tell them to go away, because whoever was out there ran screaming down the hall before I fully turned the knob.
 
Several people on that trip, including Bruni herself, reported strange happenings in their rooms overnight. The following evening, when I investigated the boiler rooms four stories below sea level, I'm certain I saw something move when no one was there.
 
My dad did not openly speculate about where he thought the cancer came from. Male breast cancer is a strange variety. There were some rumblings about how it might have come from a blow to the chest. Or the well water at the old farmhouse. My mom seemed to think it was from the furniture mills and factories he worked at as a boy.
 
My younger brother Ben, handicapped and in need of being lifted out of bed with a sling, called out wanting to know what was going on. My mom went into his room in her nightgown and explained to him in whispers and I heard them laying down together crying.
 
A wake was hastily organized, my mom made phone call after phone call. I called my friends out on the cluttered and dusty screened-in porch where we kept cardboard boxes and the dog and cat food. I rang anyone I could think of.
 
Now a visit to the beer warehouse in the strip mall, now standing in line to buy cases of wine and beer. Now going to the old-timey menswear store to buy a blazer and matching pants from the salt-and-peppered Southern gentleman, a native by his accent and demeanor.
 
When I got home, the neighbors and church people had begun to filter into the cozy, carpeted living room. They were eating snacks and I set out the wine and beer and we were surrounded by JC Penny family portraits, and Easter gatherings, and graduations, and weddings. At the wake I drank and drank.
 
A house where a person has died where the bereaved are still living is a haunted house. It holds a certain vibration, keeping the soul and the death. The frequency warbles and changes over time, affecting the feeling of the home for those that dwell there. Newcomers can sense whatever it happens to be, the grief, the longing, the day-to-day contentment that encases the grief and longing underneath, especially when the newcomer is alone there or has the knowledge that someone has died there.
 
After everything was taken care of; after my mom had gone to the old 60s funeral home with a chimney in downtown Raleigh and identified the body, and wrote them a check; after I had gone out back of the funeral home and retrieved the ashes in a cardboard box with a typewritten name on top; after she informed the insurance companies and social security administration; after placing an obituary, getting control of the email, wrangling in and shutting down old bank accounts;
 
Most people get into paranormal investigation for their love and interest in the supernatural. For me, that was not the case. Although my family and I shared several unexplainable experiences, it was my love of history that pulled me in.
 
Queen Isabella of France was born to King Philip IV of France and Queen Joan I of Navarre in Paris around 1295. From the time Isabella was an infant, her father had promised her in marriage to King Edward II of England to resolve territorial conflicts between France and England.
 
Having narrowly escaped capture by the Scots, and despite the civil war that broke out in England against Edward and Gaveston, Isabella stood by her husband. Turning to her family back in France, she wrote asking her uncles for their support of her husband while she worked to make allies of her own.
 
Roger Mortimer was an English lord, husband and father of 12 who had been arrested and imprisoned at the Tower of London by Edward II. Following his escape from the Tower, he fled to France for safety where he was eventually introduced to Isabella. As Isabella worked to assemble a court she also promised her son in marriage to Philippa, daughter of count William I of Hainault, in exchange for a large dowry. With the dowry and a loan from her brother Charles, Isabella and Roger raised an army to defeat their common enemies, Edward II and the Despensers.
 
After spending a short time under house arrest at Windsor Castle, Isabella moved into her own castle, Castle Rising. It is here that Isabella was reported to have suffered from fits of madness over the death of her love Roger Mortimer.
 
Isabella was promised in marriage to Edward II as an infant. She was a young woman who had a love for romance novels only to become a queen that was unloved and betrayed by her king. She then gave birth to a son who would grow to execute the only man she ever loved.
 
Could Queen Isabella be haunting the halls of Rising Castle, still mourning the death of Roger Mortimer? No one could really say for sure, but this is what some locals believe. Learning her story breathed life into what was otherwise just a beautiful stone shell, known as Rising Castle.
 
A creepy house, stairways to nowhere, fake doors, sance rooms, and tales of mysterious spirits; you may be thinking that this sounds like a visit to the Haunted Mansion in Disneyland, but California has its own original haunted mansion in San Jose; the Winchester Mystery House.
 
I have known about this famous mansion since I was a child. Many years ago, a publishing company put out a series of books that featured cut-out paper models of various haunted, mysterious houses. I took the time to meticulously put together a model of the Winchester Mystery House. I even remember that one of the windows had Sarah Winchester peering out from behind a curtain. I often wondered what it would be like to visit the real home. Almost fifty years later, I had the opportunity to do that with my daughter.
