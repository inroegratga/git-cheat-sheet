Metal Slug has always been a side scrolling run and gun action game known for its charm, graphics, animation and quirky charm. Metal Slug Defense is a true departure from the genre, turning it into a side-scrolling tower defense tug of war that puts you against an army where you send out units in order to destroy the enemy base (which is really just a spawner). Its geared for a mobile free-to-play market, but its more engaging than most while still making great use of a touch screen, but mouse controls are a bit cumbersome.
 
It can take a while to learn the game, but its still simple to play. You have a deck of units that cost AP to send out and your AP will build up over time. Clicking Rumi when you have enough AP to do so will raise your AP cap and make your AP raise quicker. As you play your metal slug meter will build up and once its maxed out, you can send out a tank like a giant missile to take out enemies until it blows up.

The costly units are always the best. Giant crab tanks can trump anything easy levels throw at you and you can get two for the price of three good soldiers. The problem is they move very slow and can only melee by nudging into something. There are defensive units that drop sandbags and run away. These sandbags are a defensive wall for anyone behind them.
 
To keep you playing, there are P.O.W.s to rescue one or three in each level. I feel like rescuing all of them in an area unlocked a new unit, but they at least unlock an achievement. These P.O.W.s are one of many random drops during a match that can happen. You can get cash, credits and AP boosts. If you want a P.O.W. bad enough you can spend a few medals to buy a radar item that will unlock one P.O.W. for being victorious.
 
The game looks excellent and sounds great. It feels like it would be at home twenty-five years ago. All the animations, characters are sprites are here. Nothing has been added. The backgrounds are fantastic, even if I barely notice them when playing. There are new big character graphics to stand by the side of menus and reveal who you will unlock for rescuing the P.O.W.s.
 
The menus and interface are both a bit cumbersome with a mouse. There are hot keys and buttons, but your only reminder of what they are is in the control settings section. Even a few hours in I find myself using the mouse exclusively when I should know what the hot keys are to expedite things.
