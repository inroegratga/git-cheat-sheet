Mass Effect's in-game configuration options have very little tweaking possibilities and only support basic graphic and key mapping. This article intends to serve as a guide to players who want to have more control on game performance and personalization, by highlighting options which players can tweak to better suit their needs.

The configuration files implement the CamelCase writing style for functions and variables names. For example: the 'Caps Lock' key will be written as CapsLock, 'Right mouse button' will be written as RightMouseButton, etc.
 
Note, however, that this is merely a writing convention. When entering commands in the console, you may use any case, or combination of cases, you prefer. For example: "GiveBonusTalent 14", "givebonustalent 14", "GIVEBONUSTALENT 14", and "Givebonustalent 14" will all yield the same result.

When binding a key with Control, Shift, or Alt combination in addition to the same key without that combination, make sure that the declaration with the combination precedes the one without.For example:
 
Please note, that changing critical game-play keys may cause you to not be able to interface with objects, start conversations, etc. There are also some keys that control several action and sub-actions, removing parts of the binding command can cause that key to stop behaving as expected.
 
Command="LoadGame John00\_QuickSave"The *LoadGame* function receive the name of the save as a parameter: *[profile\_name]00\_QuickSave*. Replace *[profile\_name]* with the name of your current character. This can be done with any save game file - look in your documents folder for desired name (x:\Documents and Settings\[username]\My Documents\BioWare\Mass Effect\Save\).
 
bSmoothFrameRate=True
MinSmoothedFrameRate=22
MaxSmoothedFrameRate=62bSmoothFrameRate Determines if the engine will enforce the framerate settings (True) or if it will let the graphic card manage them. This may cause spikes in FPS and unwanted graphic behavior.
 
DepthBias=0.012000Controls the depth of shadows and how dynamic shadows appear. Higher value reduces the number of shadows shown, up to 1.0 that removes shadows altogether, and a lower value increase the number of shadows shown. This setting can cause glitches or fix them by changing the value.
 
To enable the console, browse to and open the file ...Documents\BioWare\Mass Effect\Config\BioInput.ini (the full location is mentioned above) in any text editor (Notepad, for example), but not with rich text editor (Microsoft Word, OpenOffice Writer, WritePad, and the likes).
 
In the file you opened, search for *[Engine.Console]*, and add the line ConsoleKey=Tilde just under it. This will create a console around 3/4 the height of your screen. Adding the line TypeKey=Tab underneath ConsoleKey (or whatever keys you prefer) will instead create a console that is only one line wide at the bottom of your screen, allowing you full use of the console while allowing you to see in-game going-ons.
 
**Note:**some keyboard layouts, specifically on non-US English layouts, the Tilde key will map differently, and the game engine will not recognize the Tilde keyword. In this case, you will need to select a different key, such as Backslash, Tab, CapsLock, or any other to function as the console key.
 
When adding the bonus talents string be very careful for the game will only allow you to use around 5-6 offensive abilities for use in game, no matter how many abilities you add. So keep in mind that firstly you should add the abilities which are most useful*(ex.- Warp & Singularity)* fully upgrade them, then go for the other bonus talents. Also one might wanna start adding talents with *spectre* & *class talents* like - "commando".
 
Beyond changes to the configuration files, it is recommended to set your graphics card driver and settings to enhance graphic quality and performance. Below, are some recommendations for further readings:
 
Cheats and console commands can be extremely useful when facing husks and Reapers in **Mass Effect Legendary Edition**, but unfortunately, the game blocks access to the developer console by default. In the original Mass Effect trilogy, the console had many useful functions, including starting the game with tons of credits for purchasing Spectre gear and tweaking Commander Shepard's morality points. In Legendary Edition, players now need mods to access the console.
 
**Previously, players could use the Enable In-Game Console Mod from modder Mgamerz to enable the in-game console; however, that mod is now obsolete.**Instead, the popular ME3Tweaks Mod Manager developed by Mgamerz has replaced it. ME3Tweaks feature plugins that activate the console in all three games for inputting console commands. It also serves as an all-purpose program for installing other mods, including Mass Effect's popular Virmire Savior Mod.
 
**To enable console commands in Mass Effect Legendary Edition, players will need to download and unpack the ME3Tweaks Mod Manager from NexusMods.** Before installing any mods, players should create backups of their saves and game files. Modding, as well as using console commands, has the potential to cause games to behave unpredictably, corrupt save files, or break entirely. Backups can prevent players from losing their saves and make it easy to revert to an unmodded version of the game should something go awry.
 
Players can then launch Mass Effect Legendary Edition as usual, and the console should be active for all three games. First-time Mass Effect players should ideally play through the trilogy without using the console or mods to experience it as BioWare intended; however, there are several excellent Mass Effect Legendary Edition mods for later playthroughs, including one that even restores missing DLC content.
 
To pull up the console, players can use the **Tab** key. A command line will appear at the bottom of the screen where commands can be typed in. Many of the console commands from the original trilogy can still work. Others, however, may have been disabled or may be different in Mass Effect Legendary Edition. Players will want to test the various console commands to determine what works as intended. Some of the most useful commands include the following, courtesy of Modding.wiki.
 
The console commands less likely to work are those offering special armor or weapons. Console commands also differ significantly between the three games in the trilogy. Some of the commands listed above, such as SetSpeed and FOV, are mainly for convenience.
 
Others, such as Mass Effect 2's resource commands, are great for cutting down on the exploration and resource grind from that game. **However, others, such as the morality point commands and the Super Gun, are potentially game-breaking, so it's best to use them carefully.**
 
Modders hit the ground running to rebuild the extensive options available for the original Mass Effect trilogy, including the return of console commands. For those looking for Mass Effect Legendary Edition console commands (which has been a lot, my inbox is weeping), NexusMods has you covered.
 
There are two notable mods to choose from when re-activating Mass Effect's console commands. There is the Easy Console Commands mod from Seeker Erebus, found here, and the Enable In-Game Console one here from Mgamerz.
 
Keep in mind that newer versions of the mod will be needed with game updates, according to Mgamerz. "This mod edits a game file to patch out the checks used for preventing the in-game console from working. This differs from the .dll version by d00telemental because it modifies the functions on disk, rather than patching them in memory which may not occur in time due to the DRM. This makes it 100% reliable. However, it may be incompatible with newer game builds."
 
The original trilogy had some incredible mods. From changing how characters look completely to giving the story an entirely new conclusion, the community has been dedicated for years. Unfortunately, those mods have been largely rendered obsolete when looking at the Legendary Edition remaster due to the inability to utilize the popular ME3Explorer toolset. We've previously talked to the BioWare team about mods and have been working with the community to learn more about the road ahead, but despite all of that, there are quite a few new Mass Effect Legendary mods to use.

**Disclaimer:**I own nothing of the works in this thread, and take no credit of it. I am merely giving you instructions on how to achieve the purpose of what this thread was made for. Thank the modders for these wonderful gifts.
 
First, before we even get to the what this thread is mainly for, you'll need to unlock the in-game console. Or you can do this method which is a lot easier, thanks to **WarrantyVoider**. Note that you might actually have to make an account on the ME3Explorer forums if you want to view this page. It won't take long at all(and it's FREE), so I advise that you do it unless you want to go through the whole hex editing process like I did months ago.
 
The in-game console is important since it allows you to do game breaking stuff. If you need help understanding commands and what commands are possible, download this from the legendary BSN. This document will also tell you how write keybinds, but you can probably find other sources by just searching for how to write keybinds for Mass Effect 3. I also recommend that you download Notepad++ to read this file correctly.
 
Secondly, coalesced editing is essential to modding in-game properties in ME3. The coalesced editor I am using is Wenchy's Co
