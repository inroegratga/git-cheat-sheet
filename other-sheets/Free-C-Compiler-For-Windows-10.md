Unparalleled Debugging and Diagnostics Write the best, bug-free code Do all the basics like setting breakpoints and stepping through your code, then get more advanced with variable visualization, performance profiling, debugging any local or remote process, and multi-threaded application debugging. Run to click, edit your live code and continue executing without having to rebuild.
 
Visualize your code with syntax colorization, guidelines, code tooltips, Class View, or Call Hierarchy. Navigate to any code symbol by reference, definition, declaration, and more. Autocomplete your code as you type, quickly repair problems, and refactor your code to your needs. Analyze your code for common issues. Save time that could be better spent.
 
Get the latest version of MinGW-w64 via MSYS2, which provides up-to-date native builds of GCC, MinGW-w64, and other helpful C++ tools and libraries. This will provide you with the necessary tools to compile your code, debug it, and configure it to work with IntelliSense.
 
In the wizard, choose your desired Installation Folder. Record this directory for later. In most cases, the recommended directory is acceptable. The same applies when you get to setting the start menu shortcuts step. When complete, ensure the **Run MSYS2 now** box is checked and select **Finish**. This will open a MSYS2 terminal window for you.
 
The "code ." command opens VS Code in the current working folder, which becomes your "workspace". Accept the Workspace Trust dialog by selecting **Yes, I trust the authors** since this is a folder you created.
 
You can also enable Auto Save to automatically save your file changes, by selecting **File** > **Auto Save**. You can find out more about the other views in the VS Code User Interface documentation.

To see IntelliSense in action,hover over vector or string to see their type information. If you type msg. in line 10, you can see a completion list of recommended member functions to call, all generated by IntelliSense:
 
Remember, the C++ extension uses the C++ compiler you have installed on your machine to build your program. Make sure you have completed the "Installing the MinGW-w64 toolchain" step before attempting to run and debug helloworld.cpp in VS Code.
 
From now on, the play button will read from tasks.json to figure out how to build and run your program. You can define multiple build tasks in tasks.json, and whichever task is marked as the default will be used by the play button. In case you need to change the default compiler, you can run **Tasks: Configure Default Build Task** in the Command Palette. Alternatively you can modify the tasks.json file and remove the default by replacing this segment:
 
This will advance program execution to the first line of the for loop, and skip over all the internal function calls within the vector and string classes that are invoked when the msg variable is created and initialized. Notice the change in the **Variables** window on the left.
 
In this case, the errors are expected because, although the variable names for the loop are now visible to the debugger, the statement has not executed yet, so there is nothing to read at this point. The contents of msg are visible, however, because that statement has completed.
 
Press **Step over** again to advance to the next statement in this program (skipping over all the internal code that is executed to initialize the loop). Now, the **Variables** window shows information about the loop variables.
 
If you like, you can keep pressing **Step over** until all the words in the vector have been printed to the console. But if you are curious, try pressing the **Step Into** button to step through source code in the C++ standard library!
 
To return to your own code, one way is to keep pressing **Step over**. Another way is to set a breakpoint in your code by switching to the helloworld.cpp tab in the code editor, putting the insertion point somewhere on the cout statement inside the loop, and pressing F9. A red dot appears in the gutter on the left to indicate that a breakpoint has been set on this line.
 
Place the insertion point inside the loop. In the **Watch** window, select the plus sign and in the text box, type word, which is the name of the loop variable. Now view the Watch window as you step through the loop.
 
There are cases where you'd want to customize your debug configuration, such as specifying arguments to pass to the program at runtime. You can define custom debug configurations in a launch.json file.
 
In the JSON above, program specifies the program you want to debug. Here it is set to the active file folder ($fileDirname) and active filename with the .exe extension ($fileBasenameNoExtension.exe), which if helloworld.cpp is the active file will be helloworld.exe. The args property is an array of arguments to pass to the program at runtime.
 
The extension uses the compilerPath setting to infer the path to the C++ standard library header files. When the extension knows where to find those files, it can provide features like smart completions and **Go to Definition** navigation.
 
C++ is a compiled language meaning your program's source code must be translated (compiled) before it can be run on your computer. The C/C++ extension doesn't include a C++ compiler or debugger, since VS Code as an editor relies on command-line tools for the development workflow. You need to install these tools or use the tools already installed on your computer.
 
The output should show you the compiler version and details. If neither are found, make sure your compiler executable is in your platform path (%PATH on Windows, $PATH on Linux and macOS) so that the C/C++ extension can find it. Otherwise, use the instructions in the section below to install a compiler.
 
**Note**: If you would prefer a full Integrated Development Environment (IDE), with built-in compilation, debugging, and project templates (File > New Project), there are many options available, such as the Visual Studio Community edition.
 
In the wizard, choose your desired Installation Folder. Record this directory for later. In most cases, the recommended directory is acceptable. The same applies when you get to setting the start menu shortcuts step. When complete, ensure the **Run MSYS2 now** box is checked and select **Finish**. A MSYS2 terminal window will then automatically open.
 
You should see output that states which versions of GCC, g++ and GDB you have installed. If this is not the case, make sure your PATH entry matches the Mingw-w64 binary location where the compiler tools are located or reference the troubleshooting section.
 
GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool that helps you write code faster and smarter. You can use the GitHub Copilot extension in VS Code to generate code, or to learn from the code it generates.
 
If you run into any issues or have suggestions for the Microsoft C/C++ extension, please file issues and suggestions on GitHub. If you haven't already provided feedback, you can take this quick survey.
 
We have recently started having an issue in my organization where exe's generated by Intel Fortran are being blocked by Windows Defender as security risks. All these exe's do is to read input data from text files, crunch numbers and print out the results to text or HDF files; usual Fortran stuff. Talking to our security folks, they say they haven't changed anything in their security policies and the problem is originating from Windows Defender. We are using Visual Studio 2019 as the IDE.
 
I had similar problems with Symantec several years ago. I was able to submit my exe's to Symantec to be scanned, after which they were added to the white list. After 24-48 hours, when the new signature files were distributed to users, I was able to distribute the apps to other users.
 
Our organization-wide security protocols are managed by our IT staff so I don't have control over modifying the white list. On my end, all I see is an "Access Denied" error even for a program as simple as Hello World. After many back-and-forth emails with IT staff, I was connected to the security group and they told me it is the Windows Defender blocking the exe's.
 
They will "whilelist" my entire account so that should solve my problem (I'll believe it when I see, though). The issue is that I share these exe's with other people from my organization so I am not sure if the IT is willing to give everybody a blanket security clearance.
 
If I read this correctly (I had to look up "prevalence"), this rule triggers if you have an executable that not everybody has or something you just built and did not put in a directory that is left unwatched. Gosh, there are probably good reasons to do so, but that makes developing programs even more difficult than it already is.
