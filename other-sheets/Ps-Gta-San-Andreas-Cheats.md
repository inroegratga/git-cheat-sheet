That's not true about gta3. Cheats do not stop you from getting 100%. I did it myself. In vice city, cheats don't disable trophies either. However some cheats do negatively affect your criminal rating which can affect your ability to platinum.
 
yes it does, I was exploring los Santos with the jet pack then one of the gang on the street talked to me when I was on the ground, I tried to reply to him by randomly pressed left and right on the D-pad (I didn't know what I did but a screen (similar to the ones that the ps3 shows when you press hold the PS button) popped up to me saying something like you have entered a cheat, trophies will be locked.
 
I can confirm that in GTA 3 and Vice City, you CAN use cheats. However, for the Criminal Rating based trophies, using cheats will make it harder obtain such trophies. For some reason, some cheats escape the Criminal Rating Penalty, such as the "Destroy All Cars" cheat in Vice City (a cheat used in getting the "Take the Cannoli" 1,000,000 Criminal Rating Cheat.) Others have low penalties, while others have absurd ones.
 
In San Andreas, I tried to use the "Lower Wanted Level" cheat during the Vigilante Missions. Once I beat level 12, the trophy DID NOT pop, thus confirming that using cheats in San Andreas disables trophies.
