Hi Tim, thanks for the reply. I understand how as a company, you can not support what I am trying to do. In a recent update, AT&T managed to stop the functionality of wifi mode in foxfi for the Galaxy s4 active. It does work with a direct USB connection. I want to use it to feed my iPad which will not work in USB, or in bluetooth without jailbreaking. I was hoping to be able to configure PDAnet between phone and laptop, then insert the SOTG in cellular mode and have it work. If anyone outside the company can suggest ways to work a config, it would be appreciated. Larry

In looking through the above posts, is Fresno able to use his Nexus 4 tether as a WAN through a Peplink router connecting via usb or is he using a wireless WAN connect on a Peplink router? (Samsung GS4, Android 4.2.2, rooted. PdaNet+ and FoxFi)
 
The optimum solution would be for Peplink to create a specific USB tether app for Android / IOS. As a SOHO user, I would happily pay for it! I would expect others would also be happy to pay if they knew they could easily bond to their existing connection.
 
I had previously installed an Android app called the Xposed Installer framework so I could use another app called XPrivacy to dramatically improve Android privacy. There was an add-on I was not aware of called Wanam Xposed designed for my GS4. Once I installed Wanam Xposed, I just went to to system and clicked Disable Tether Provisioning.
 
Speedtest went from a max of less than 5meg download / .66 meg upload (in the very best of circumstances), to over 16 megs download and over 3meg uploads. We can now stream video consistently, which we could never do previously. (And we now also have a back-up internet source.)
