If you travel abroad, access rights will be different as well, so buying a guidebook will be a great starting point. In England and Wales bikes are permitted only on public rights of way, with the following allowing for cycling:
 
There are also other routes with public access like cycle routes or permissive bridleways, along which landowners have permitted public use. Those are not rights of way. All the above are liable to change and may not be clearly defined on the ground. Please check with the relevant local authority for the latest information. It is trespass (currently a civil offence, although this is under review) to cycle on footpaths in England and Wales, unless the landowner gives permission.

avoid unnecessary damage to the crops). You can take access to golf courses (except greens and tees), but only to cross the area and without interfering with play. At golf courses cyclists need to keep to paths at all times. You are also allowed to cycle off-path, but encouraged to avoid going onto wet, boggy or soft ground, and churning up the surface.
 
Rare species, like capercaillie in Scotland, are easily, and often unintentionally, disturbed by humans. In areas like national parks it helps to stick to trails that have been carefully designed, like these gravel and bikepacking routes here in the Cairngorms National Park.
 
Over the years I have found great inspiration in good books and maps. And while freely available tourist maps, either in printed form or online, are often only of limited use for cycling, they might still have good information for planning your own route. While paying for a well-researched book will set you back by a few quid, it is money well spent. Here are suggestions from six years of reading and writing books. Some of the books might be out of print, check out your local library or used book shops.

In this episode of Mears Moments, we welcome Janaya Gurewitz, a passionate travel agent from Minnesota with a deep affection for Disney World. Janaya shares her journey from childhood visits to Disney World, fueled by her grandfather living in Florida, to becoming a travel agent helping families craft their dream vacations to the magical park. Her love for Disney, enhanced by her adult financial independence, allows her to visit the parks at least twice a year, despite the logistical challenges of coming from the Midwest.
 
Janaya dives into the practical aspects of visiting Disney World, including travel tips and preferences for getting from the airport to the park. Janaya expresses a strong preference for Mears Transportation due to its cost-effectiveness and convenience, especially when compared to other options like Uber, which requires car seats for children. She outlines the benefits of using Mears for her and her clients, emphasizing budget considerations and the efficiency of their service.
 
The conversation transitions to the value of using a travel agent for planning Disney vacations. Janaya explains that travel agents are compensated by travel vendors, making their extensive planning services free for clients. She argues that this professional assistance is particularly valuable at Disney World, where ongoing changes and complex planning can overwhelm visitors. Janaya believes that having a knowledgeable agent simplifies the process, making vacations more enjoyable and less stressful.

Following these three steps, operators can create guidance plans for the entire season in just one sitting, before the plan is sent to the display in preparation for the commencement of work when it's time to put machinery in the field.
 
"This is going to be a great feature for our small grains customers and one we have been waiting for. It will allow operators to take advantage of our path planning tool and, if they are Controlled Traffic Farming, leverage existing guidance lines and investment in CTF," Mr Cusack said.
 
"This is a John Deere exclusive, and it provides farmers with the flexibility to adjust guidance plans that were created online directly within their G5 or Gen 4 display without having to go back into Ops Center to alter the plan.
 
In-field guidance tracks can be easily modified using one of the three track-generation methods (Heading Angle, Align to Boundary, or From an Existing Track) and by shifting tracks north/south/east/west (in-field tracks) or inward/outward (headland tracks).
 
**After I earned my engineering doctorate at the University of Texas, I accepted a teaching position at Texas A&M University. By 1982, I was ready to return to the field and put principles to practice.**
 
I left that construction project to teach a summer graduate school class on construction productivity at Texas A&M. As part of the course, I sent five teams of students to construction sites to see how productivity could be improved. The students set out armed with high-tech tools and prepared to conduct sophisticated measurement and analysis. I expected them to come back with recommendations to improve productivity at their sites by changes in project staffing, equipment use and the like.
 
After the course ended, I spent some time giving presentations at construction companies across the U.S. I shared my questions about planning with top managers at the best companies. No one threw me out of the room, and that was enough to keep me going. I continued to struggle to understand what I had observed.
 
It is so clear to me now, but it took me years to reach these conclusions. Before I could, I had to let go of assumptions that I had been taught. So much of learning, I have come to realize, begins with unlearning.
 
Remember, excellence and perfection are not the same thing. If we are striving for excellence, growth, and improvement, the best path forward is not waiting for some unattainable moment of perfection, but rather starting the journey and then learning and growing along the way.
 
Traditional wisdom invites those starting a work project or large journey to engage in a process of extensive planning. The goal in this linear mindset is to do all of the planning for the project up front. Those involved with this first step must foresee all possible needs, opportunities, and obstacles, and then solidify a plan before proceeding.

Along with changing the radio station every five seconds in search of a better song, one of my driving foibles is having the car temperature set to coldish. Nobody wants car sickness from being trapped in a hot moving bubble. I was doing a reading at the wedding and wanted to be in ripper shape from the roadie. So, a bag of jersey caramels, tons of bad singing and Arctic temperatures.
 
Sharon and Ian\\u2019s wedding was a lunch affair in Bright. In morning traffic, almost four hours\\u2019 drive from the family home in Williamstown. Kids dropped at the station and dog fed, I burned off solo in the Kia Carnival about 7.30am, in a good dress and towering strappy Chloe sandals.
 
Groom Ian was on welcome duties at the door of the winery when I pulled up. Ace. My scheduling and Be Your Best strategy seemed to have paid off. Until I got out of the car, fell over and couldn\\u2019t stand. My feet were legit frozen.
 
We tried punching my useless lump of ice feet to restore circulation. Nothing doing. Ian hoisted me onto his back, and we set off across the car park. Undignified, sure, but going well \\u2013 until the bridal car arrived. Ian was torn. Help me or greet his gorgeous bride? He slid me to the ground. I pulled myself up onto a wall and inched inside, nodding and smiling. Yes, the village idiot has arrived.
 
When the time came for the reading \\u2013 the lyrics to a Nick Cave song \\u2013 I used the backs of chairs for support to stagger slowly up like Keyser Soze when he\\u2019s pretending not to be a criminal mastermind.
