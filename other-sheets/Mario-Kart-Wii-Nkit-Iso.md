I updated to 5.27 last night and prior to updating, although the dolphin emulator never appealingly saved any settings for upscaling, GameCube and Wii games looked incredible running flawlessly in 4K. Last night after the update I went to make a change to the controller mapping and looked around in the graphic section to see that my settings were set to how I thought they were. However today I went to play Mario kart and it gave me an error message saying the type of file I had was unsupported (nkit.iso) so I uploaded a .wbfs version and it worked but looked terrible. I thought it was the file type but then realized all my games both for GameCube and Wii look awful. I tried altering with the settings and now nothing is saving. I also tried altering the new game settings section but still cannot upscale them. Please let me know what I can do short of wiping the drive and doing a fresh instal.

Try the following:
Do a factory reset (see down below here: )
After that you can upscale the internal resolution of GameCube and Wii within ES under Game Settings, Per System Advanced Configuration, Gamecube/Wii (Internal Resolution).
