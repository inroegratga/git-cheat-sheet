ISO/IEC 25020:2007 provides a measurement reference model and guide for measuring the quality characteristics defined in ISO/IEC 2501n, Quality Model Division. ISO/IEC 25020:2007 sets requirements for the selection and construction of quality measures. It also contains informative annexes addressing the following topics: criteria for selecting software quality measures and quality measure elements, demonstrating predictive validity and assessing measurement reliability, and an example format for documenting software quality measures.
 
The Quality Measurement Division, of which ISO/IEC 25020 is a member, also offers examples of quality measures that can be used across the product development life cycle. These measures are defined in the other documents in the division and correspond to the quality characteristics in a software product quality model such as that described in ISO/IEC 25010. ISO/IEC 25020:2007 and the quality measures are designed to be used, in particular, with other standards in the SQuaRE series that address quality requirements (ISO/IEC 25030) and product quality evaluation (ISO/IEC 25040).

ISO/IEC 25020 provides a framework for developing quality measurement and contains quality measurement reference model relationships between different types of quality measures guidelines for selecting quality measures, constructing quality measures, planning and performing quality measurements.
 
ISO/IEC 25020 can be applied for designing, identifying, evaluating and executing the measurement model of system and software product quality, quality in use, data quality and IT service quality. This reference model can be used by developers, acquirers, quality assurance staff and independent evaluators essentially by people responsible for specifying and evaluating the quality of information and communication technology (ICT) systems and services.
 
Overall, ISO/IEC 25020 provides a framework that you can use to develop software so that bugs and errors can be identified during the testing stage, making the end product better and improving the user experience.
