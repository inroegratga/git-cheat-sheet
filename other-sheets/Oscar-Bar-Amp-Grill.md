If you are like me, then you have probably never heard of Grilled Steak Oscar. There are so many turn of the century recipes that I have been keen on trying recently, and one of them is this very dish.

Traditionally, this dish is made with veal cutlets instead of steak; but, I am one that liked to break culinary rules. It is usually served with asparagus, topped with crab meat and an emulsified butter sauce. This is what we attempted at making, but this time over the open pit fire.
 
Finally, we come to the fun part. Seasoned the steak with oil, salt and pepper, then I grilled it over the fire until it was 120F internal. While the steak cooks, we are going to add the asparagus with seasoning and saute the lump crab. All that should come off the grill around the same time, and we then are ready to plate this Grilled Steak Oscar. Starting with a base layer of asparagus, next the steak, top that with lump crab and finally the bearnaise sauce to finish. This is an epic recipe for any special moment. Cheers and happy New Year!

Serve this delicious steak oscar with fresh asparagus for that classic steakhouse dinner. Or serve it with fresh green beans and roasted potatoes. 
Pair this recipe with coal-roasted oysters for a truly unforgettable feast!
