I've been locked out of my Windows 10 computer (yeah, I know, should've written down the password) and I'm scratching my head on how to get back in. Has anyone here been through this and managed to reset their password without being able to log in?
 
I've seen a few methods online involving bootable USB drives and using command prompts, but I'm not super tech-savvy and a bit hesitant to dive into something that seems so complex. I'm looking for a more straightforward, beginner-friendly way to reset my password and get back to my files.

[**Edit**] A few folks asked me if the problem was solved? Yes. The password was reset with the help of **Passcue Windows Password Recovery software**. Thanks Jack888 for the recommendation!
 
Once, I also encountered a situation where I forgot Windows 10 password of local account. I was really a little panicked at that time. After all, all the important files were in that account. I remember that I really didn't want to use those complicated technical means at that time, and wondered if there was a simple way to solve it.
 
So, I saw a "**Reset Password**" link on the login screen. Although I hadn't noticed it before, I decided to click it this time. After clicking it, the system prompted me to answer the security questions I had set before. I was quite glad that I didn't fill in some random answers at that time. The question was the name of my elementary school. I remembered that I set the name of my alma mater and answered it without hesitation. Then the system actually let me enter the interface for setting a new password.
 
After entering and confirming the new password, I was able to log in smoothly. This experience made me realize that setting security questions is really useful, especially when you forget Windows 10 password.
 
@zcbadeedee Ophcrack is not recommended if the password was strong enough. Ophcrack relies on rainbow tables to recover the forgotten Windows 10 passwords. These tables are precomputed lists of possible passwords and their corresponding hashes. If a password is complex (long, uses special characters, or is otherwise not common), it may not be included in the available rainbow tables.
 
In addition, Ophcrack has not been actively updated to handle newer hashing algorithms or security measures implemented in Windows 10 and 11. Newer versions of Windows have strengthened password security. So it is no longer a good choice to **reset Windows 10 password** when the computer is locked due to forgotten password.
 
Once, I also encountered a situation where I **forgot my Windows 10 password**. I was really anxious at the time, after all, all my important documents and work data were on that computer. I tried various possible password combinations, but none of them worked. At this time, I remembered that I had a backup consciousness before and made a Windows 10 password reset disk.

I quickly rummaged through the boxes and found the USB drive and inserted it into the computer. I restarted the computer and went to the login screen. I saw a link to "Reset Password" and clicked it without hesitation. The system recognized my password reset disk and began to guide me step by step.
 
A Windows 10 password reset disk is a special type of disk that allows you to reset Windows 10 user account password if you forget it. This disk is created while you still have access to your account and can be used in case you get locked out. The below tutorial shows you **how to reset Windows 10 password without logging in**:
 
Once, I forgot Windows 10 password and it felt like the end of the world. I tried all possible passwords but none of them worked, and I became more and more anxious. However, I suddenly remembered that a friend once told me about a way to reset Windows 10 password using the command prompt. I didn't pay much attention to it at the time because it seemed too complicated, but now it has become a lifesaver.
 
So, I decided to give this method a try. First, I needed a Windows installation disk or a bootable USB drive. Fortunately, I had an old Windows installation disk at home, so I immediately found it, inserted it into the computer, and restarted to enter the installation interface.
 
Step 5. Open the Command Prompt: At the login screen, click the "Accessibility" icon (usually a small circle icon) in the lower right corner. Now, the Command Prompt should open instead of Accessibility.
 
Although this method sounds a bit complicated, it is actually quite smooth to follow the steps. After the operation, I successfully logged in to the computer with the new password, and the big stone in my heart finally fell. I really recommend that if you are also locked out, you can try this method, but you must be careful in operation, after all, it involves modifying system files.
 
You put it in a bootable usb and you start it without starting windows, you start from the usb as if you were going to format, you start a miniwindows lite loaded in ram and it has a utility to change password that if you leave it blank you remove it

Since Windows 8, most people are now using a Microsoft account for logging into Windows. When you forgot your Microsoft account password, just use another computer to visit the Windows Live password reset page on the Microsoft website, and you can reset the password online. It's relatively easier than resetting local account password.
 
This method requires you to have access to the alternate email account or phone number you provided when signing up the Microsoft account. If you don't have access to those anymore, Microsoft will be unable to verify your identity. In that case, you can convert Windows 10 Microsoft account to a local account from a boot media, so you can log back into Windows 10 without losing files.

Once you've reset Windows 10 password and get back into your system, make sure you set a new password that you won't forget next time. It's also good practice to create a Windows 10 password reset disk if you use quite complicated password for security reason.

However, programs that have been installed since the restore point have to be installed again.
 
Hey there 
**Levon'te Scott**To reset it, you can try booting into Safe Mode and change things through Command Prompt. Once you're in Safe Mode, log in using the built-in admin account (if it doesn't have a password, even better).Now, let's open Command Prompt with admin privileges. Right-click on the Start button and choose "Command Prompt (Admin)." Then, use this nifty command:
 
Replace "NewPassword" with your desired password. Give it a shot, reboot your laptop, and then log in with the administrator account using the new password. Fingers crossed this does the trick .**If this helps kindly accept the answer thanks much.**
