I have downloaded all the windows support drivers from bootcamp assistant but nothing seems to be working, reinstalled, repaired the drivers etc. it says 'driver error' could you send a link to correct driver for wireless keyboard. Maybe, it is the driver!
 
I installed bootcamp the both to a mac mini, and everything works fine there (wireless keyboard too), but for the installation onto a macpro late 2013 everything works fine, WI-FI, GPU, wireless mouse, BT, etc. all of the drivers are OK, with the exception of the wireless keyboard where the bluetooth manager says: Driver Error.

You have to go to "Device Manager" (right click on Start: Device Manager option), at the HID leaf (that stands open 'cause of a driver error), simply uninstall and delete the wrong driver. Magically everything works fine, and the wireless keyboard will be reported on the Keyboards leaf of the Device Manager.
 
This didn't work for me. I have exactly the same problem. It says "driver error" for the keyboard, while the magic mouse works fine. If I delete the driver, it shows a "System Administrator's Keyboard" is connected with bluetooth, but the keyboard still doesn't work.
 
Upon imaging a Surface Laptop 2 with our basic image from the older Surface laptop model the Surface Hid Mini Driver driver fails to power and thus the keyboard doesn't work. if I revert back to 03/27/2017 driver it works fine... but then the laptop automatically updates itself to the latest version that brakes again. I have blocked the update in WSUS.
 
Is anybody aware of a fix for the latest driver? Does the PC somehow think its a Surface Laptop 1st gen and somehow downloading the incorrect driver possibly? I also downloaded the latest firmware/driver package from MS and tried that version and it also doesn't work. Seems to be the same exact version that gets downloaded from Windows Update.
 
@WC\_KStil did you ever get the specific version of the driver that works? I keep running into this issue every update cycle. I have a surface laptop 2 and the "Surface Hid Mini Driver" flakes out every update. I've tried the all of the drivers from Download Surface Laptop 2 Drivers and Firmware from Official Microsoft Download Center :
 
I've tried uninstalling the driver and re-installing but that never seems to work, even disabling the driver and re-enabling doesn't work. I'm not sure what happens in UEFI entry, but that seems to make it work again for me. Beware - your mileage may vary!!! This seems to be a very common issue but different tasks seem to work for different people. I sure hope Microsoft can fix this as it is a pain as it usually happens when I really need to get some work done!
 
Sign in and select Surface Laptop 2 and input your Surface's serial number. Click on Download and Save it to your desktop. Do not download the Recovery Image directly on the USB drive but on the Downloads folder on the computer.

@GBowlsby - this worked perfectly. Frustratingly, I'd foolishly listened to other ideas with consequences that'll now cost me even more time (somehow our AI/ML needs to intercept bad or half-arse solutions with ones that actually work :)) Regardless to my live 'en learn: Thanks!
 
The only thing I can think of is that this model of Dell Precision was not tested in the Fall Creator update back in OCT17 by Dell. Drivers were not updated, so either some other driver might work or there is no telling if something could hose the drivers all together. It also could be possible that Windows 10 is not supported for this machine all together.
 
Another possibility is that someone could have plugged something into the USB ports causing Windows to flake out for I/O device drivers. I did one more test and was able to read/write a flash drive, but not a desktop scanner or other brand/model keyboard and mouse.
 
I was having this same issue, just with a different model of keyboard/mouse (Dell machine and wireless keyboard/mouse combo) and after uninstalling the KB4074588 update like michellelieske suggested, the issue was resolved. I was able to remote into the machines and uninstall that way. My best guess is that it was a registry change made by the patch that caused the issue.
 
The issue was that most USB devices would not be recognized, as well as the touch screen would not work. The USB devices would return a code 28. For example, plugging in a mouse would cause the red light on it to appear for several seconds before turning off. I had tried disabling selective suspend by editing the registry and a lot of other unsuccessful items.
 
My keyboard is not working. I believe I might have accidentally removed keyboard driver. On turning my laptop on, I get password screen. How do I get back keyboard driver back? I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 18.04.
 
Recently after my laptop starts up, the built-in keyboard stopped working. I solved this problem before by going to the Device Manager and updating the driver, but now when I try to to that it shows the following: "Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19)." It's apparent that the driver became corrupted. I uninstalled it and went to the HP Support Assistant, but it didn't find any new drivers. Is there any way to get the driver from another location?
 
I restarted my computer again, and the problem reapeared. I tried to use the new account, and the keyboard was still not working. As I type this, I am performing another system restore to temporarily fix it again. If you have any other solutions, I would be glad to hear them.
 
Thanks for the reply. I did verify that an external keyboard does work (I'm actually writing this on the affected computer). I did try using the Recovery Manager as you said, but I can't seem to find any keyboard drivers to install through it.
 
Also, it's worth noting that I did try doing a system restore to see that it will do anything and it worked, even though it told me that it couldn't be finished. The keyboard now works, but I'm sure that the next time I restart the computer, the keyboard driver will become corrupted again. Is there any way to prevent that?
 
Thanks again for the reply. I made another administrator account, as you told me to do. I have never logged in to it and have never interacted with it. Last night, it seems that my computer restarted itself for updates, and the keyboard still works. I'm not completely sure if this means the issue is resolved, so I'll stay wary for now. If the problem returns, I'll be sure to let you know.
 
It looks like, creating the new account could have triggered the updates to go through, however, to ensure the issue is completely resolved, I recommend you work on it for a few days and if the issue shows its ugly face, try using the new user account to check if that works.
 
This post is an introductory post to a series that will describe my journey to analyze and learn how the keyboard backlight driver on my laptop works, and then re-implement it on my own. I wanted a place to dump my thoughts and different things I try, and learn in the process. 
This post is just an intro to the series, if you're looking for the actual action, head over to the next post in the series!
 
I recently upgraded to a new laptop **(HP Omen 15-en0037AX)**. The laptop has a four-zone RGB LED backlight on the keyboard. Like most laptops that ship with such a keyboard, the manufacturer shipped a preinstalled app **(Omen Light Studio)** on windows to customize the various lighting modes on the keyboard.
 
Since I have always been interested in cybersecurity and have taken part in multiple CTF (Capture the Flag) events, I have a basic understanding of how to Reverse Engineer C/C++ binaries using tools like Ghidra but have never reversed an actual real-life application. In this series I want to (hopefully) achieve two things:
 
This series is going to be me documenting all my approaches (right or wrong), and also explaining various concepts I learned in the process. Currently, I have no idea where this will lead to or what tools/languages I need to know/learn, but all that begins from the next post. See you there!
 
I am searching a driver for getting the usb keyboard working in DOS, i.e. i plug in a PCI USB 2.0 card and insert the USB keyboard in there but nothing happens; of course the BIOS don't have USB keyboard support
 
But the best bet to do in a system that does not have USB support in BIOS is to use a USB-to-PS/2 adapter, which is cheap, easily available and risk-failure free. Or just get a PS/2 keyboard, which are still sold. (Just make sure the USB keyboard is a basic keyboard without fancy backlights and/or programmable keyboard. Complex USB keyboards might not work with the adapter.
 
USB driver in DOS is a possibility, in supported systems, but not advisable unless absolutely necessary. The base driver takes up memroy space. And not all systems are compatible. Furthermore, these USB drivers are designed for use with newer systems, which do not have access to legacy devices, and may not be suitable to be used in older systems.
 
I have looked in the usb-dos matter in the past. I have successfully used a usb stick to transfer files with a usb2 pci card on a p1mmx system. It was a nice achievement but other than that it was dog slow. 
My advice is not to bother with USB stuff in DOS. Just get a ps2 keyboard.
