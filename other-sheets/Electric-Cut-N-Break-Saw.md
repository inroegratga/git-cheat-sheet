The electric brake controller works by sensing the vehicle's braking action and sending appropriate signals to the trailer's electric brakes, enabling proportional braking between the towing vehicle and the trailer.
 
No, not all electric brake controllers are the same. Electric brake controllers come in various types and models, each offering different features and capabilities. The main types of electric brake controllers are:

When choosing an electric brake controller, it's essential to consider factors such as the type of towing you'll be doing, the weight of the trailer, the towing vehicle's capabilities, and your preference for features and adjustability. Ensure that the brake controller you select is compatible with your vehicle and trailer setup and that it meets your towing needs for safety and efficiency.
 
Yes, you can install an electric brake controller yourself if you have the necessary tools, skills and wiring instructions. Product manuals are available online, plus videos and electric brake controller wiring guides are available in our resources section.
 
Brake controllers are not typically "plug and play" devices, but some modern models come with features that make installation easier and more straightforward. The installation process for a brake controller involves connecting it to the vehicle's electrical system and setting it up to work with the trailer's electric brakes.
 
In Australia, trailers with a Gross Trailer Mass (GTM) exceeding 750 kg are required to have brakes fitted. Additionally, trailers with a Gross Combination Mass (GCM) over a certain limit may also require brakes. For trailers that require brakes, it is essential to have a suitable electric brake controller installed in the towing vehicle.
 
If your caravan's GTM is above 750 kg, it is essential to have brakes installed on the caravan. And when your caravan has brakes, it is typically a legal requirement to have an appropriate brake controller installed in the towing vehicle.
 
An **electric friction brake**, often referred to as just **electric brake**[1] or **electric trailer brake**, is a brake controlled by an electric current and can be seen on medium duty trailers like caravans/RVs and consumer-grade car trailers. It is related to the electromagnetic track brake used in railways which also use electric current to directly control the brake force.
 
Braking starts with applying a current proportional to the desired brake force to the electromagnet (5) which is pulled axially towards the drum. If the wheel is rotating the drum will then pull the actuating arm (4) either to the left or to the right depending on the rotation of the wheel. The actuating arm is pivoted on the black round pin that is anchored to the brake shield. This in turn applies pressure on one of the brake shoes which comes into contact with the brake drum. The first brake shoe then tries to follow the rotation while asserting friction and thereby propagate the movement onto the second brake shoe through the adjuster which also pushes against the drum. The friction force is then caught by the stopper (Black trapezoid) mounted on the brake shield.
 
The braking force asserted is caused by the friction between the electromagnet and the face of the drum which depends on the current through the electromagnet (as stated before). The force applied on the brake shoes is counteracted by one of the reactor springs (which one depends on the direction of the rotation) so that when the current through the electromagnet is withdrawn the spring ensures that the actuating arm is returned to its resting position and the brake shoes are retracted from the drum.
 
The electric current controlling the brake through the electromagnet is provided from a brake controller which provides the control current from the towing vehicle. There are different types of brake controllers on the market, each with their own advantages and disadvantages.
 
The current controlling the brakes from the towing vehicle is originating in the battery/alternator of the towing vehicle via the brake controller and then transferred via wiring through the electric brake pin in the trailer connector through the trailer wiring to the electromagnet and back through the trailer wiring to the trailer connector and to the towing vehicle chassis/frame through the ground pin in the trailer connector.
 
Kirchhoff's circuit laws are the basics for how to understand problems with the electrics. Electrical faults involving brakes can range from annoying to dangerous so it is important to really get it working right.
 
When tracing faults it is important to try to see all symptoms, since that can lead to a component that is common for all parts. And one component that really is taking a beating in most trailer electrical wiring is the ground pin of the connector since it has to handle all return current from the trailer to the towing vehicle.
 
Adjustment of the brake is done through the adjuster (6) which basically is a screw that can be accessed when the brake is assembled. The adjustment is necessary to make sure that the brake is working as expected and not applying brake force when not expected by having too tight margins while still retaining a good responsiveness from the brake.
 
The brake shoes are wear items and need to be replaced when worn down. The magnet also has a pad that shall be inspected when the brake shoes are replaced. If the magnet pad is worn (if such exist on the brake in question) it shall also be replaced. The drum itself is also a wear item and needs to be replaced when certain wear limits have been reached to ensure that it is safe to use.
 
If excessive braking occurs the electromagnet itself can suffer a burn-out through overheating and need to be replaced. However the environment inside the brake drum can be very tough on electric parts. This means that the magnet itself shall be tested while the drum is removed and be replaced if needed.
 
what i have to do if i want to change the electric rear parking brake? The electric parking brake is seatet. I cant get extend the electric servo motor. At the Internet (link) i saw i have to deactivate the electric parking brake and open it - HOW? What is the right way to open the parkig brake with OBDeleven?
 
The coupling contains a sliding shaft attached to the tow ball. The shaft slides when pushed due to the vehicle slowing down and exerts pressure directly on a mechanical linkage (mechanical brakes) or a link connected to a hydraulic cylinder, which in turn creates hydraulic pressure on the braking system (hydraulic brakes). These are often found on camper trailers or boat trailers.
 
Advancements in microprocessors and wireless technology have changed how electric towing systems work. Launched in 2017, the latest innovation in electric brake controllers is Australian designed, produced, and called Elecbrakes: a remote mount electric trailer brake controller installed directly on the trailer, rather than within the tow vehicle.
 
An intuitive, smartphone-based solution for any trailer that gets towed by more than one vehicle, Elecbrakes eliminates the need to modify every single car used for towing purposes. Instead, the compact device goes directly on the trailer and contains a high-speed microprocessor connected to sensors, which continuously sample the operating parameters of the brakes.
 
Elecbrakes are compatible with 12V and 24V voltage systems and designed to operate 1 to 2 braked axles. It is also 100% dust and waterproof thanks to its tough fibre reinforced housing with the electronics fully encased in urethane.
 
We believe an intelligent, trailer-based, wireless electric brake controller such as Elecbrakes makes towing so much simpler and gives you the freedom to be more flexible and spontaneous to tow with a broader range of vehicles.
 
Electric brakes and their controllers are essential for managing heavier loads, as it requires significant power and control to bring the weight of the trailer (and the towing vehicle) to a complete stop. For any owner considering towing their trailer with more than one vehicle, Elecbrakes is the best solution in terms of electronic brake controllers.
 
The law also requires trailers over 2,000kg GTM have a breakaway system**.** A breakaway system is a device that ensures the trailer slows down on its own accord in the hazardous and unpredictable event that it becomes disconnected from your vehicle while moving.
 
We at Elecbrakes have developed the electric brake controller that fits the bill. Elecbrakes is a proportional brake controller mounted onto the trailer rather than the car, eliminating the need for hardwiring the tow vehicle.
 
Once installed on the trailer, Elecbrakes will open up a world of opportunities. Any vehicle big enough to tow your trailer can now do so, with no additional set-up procedures or costs apart from a tow bar. In addition, there is no drilling of the dashboard or hardwiring of the vehicle necessary.
 
**Our app is also fully customisable:** The driver can easily control the brake response with precise settings (you can choose up to 5 favourite programs) through the smartphone app, available both for Apple and Android.
